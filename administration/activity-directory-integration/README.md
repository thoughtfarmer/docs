# Activity Directory integration



### Active Directory integration

If you use Active Directory to manage network access at your organization, you can use ThoughtFarmer's Employee Directory Connector \(EDC\) to provide easy user authentication and management on your ThoughtFarmer site. The EDC provides synchronization between Active Directory and ThoughtFarmer that keeps groups, security profiles, and employee contact information up-to-date across both systems. The EDC allows for full Active Directory integration for ThoughtFarmer Cloud and on-premise clients, and allows for integration with multiple Active Directories.
