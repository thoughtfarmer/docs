# Group page synchronization

### Group page synchronization

Group page synchronization must be enabled if you wish to sync ThoughtFarmer group membership with Active Directory groups.

**Before you begin:**  
Ensure that [AD integration has been enabled and configured](active-directory-basic-settings/) on the Active Directory page. Only basic integration needs to be set up. Write access is not required.

#### Configure group page synchronization

1. Go to the ThoughtFarmer **Administration panel**: **Users & security** section &gt; **Employee directory connector** page.
2. Click on the **Active directory name** for which you want to configure group page synchronization.
3. In the **Group page synchronization** section at the bottom of the page, click **enable**.
