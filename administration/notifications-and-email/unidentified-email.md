# Unidentified email

### Unidentified email

When ThoughtFarmer receives an email message, it follows these rules:

* If the message is addressed to a mailing list, then the message will get added to the archive page for the mailing list.
* If the message is not addressed to a mailing list, then ThoughtFarmer determines which user sent the message, and adds the page as private content beneath the profile page of that user.

Any message that fails the above rules will be placed into the unidentified email queue, which can be found by going to the ThoughtFarmer **Administration Panel**: **Notifications** section &gt; **Unidentified email** page.

### Handling unidentified email

On the unidentified email page, all of the unidentified email messages are listed in a table. You can quickly see why the message ended up on this page by checking the **Status** column.
