### Notifications & Email

ThoughtFarmer has a number of mechanisms that allow for information to be pulled from and added to the intranet. Emails sent to ThoughtFarmer by users will be created as private pages under their place page. Mailing lists can be synced with in order to capture all discussions so they are stored and search-able from within ThoughtFarmer. Additionally, site activity can be tracked by way of email notifications and RSS feeds.
