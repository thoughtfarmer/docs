# Manage followers

You can add followers to a page so that they will be notified of changes to that page. See the page [Overview of following and notification alerts](../../using-thoughtfarmer/basic-features/following-and-alerts/) to learn about following and how to add individual followers to a page.  
  
If you want to add many followers to a page at once, use the **Manage following** page on the Admin panel.

## Add followers to a page in bulk

1. Go to the **Admin panel**: **Content** section &gt; **Manage following** page.
2. In the **Find content** box, start typing the name of the page you want to add followers to.
3. Click on the page name when it appears in the dropdown menu. A list of the current page followers will appear.
4. Start typing the **name** of a person in the **Filter** box to filter the list of followers.
5. To add followers, click **Add followers**. In the **Add followers** pop-up window that appears, start typing the name of a person or group, and click on the name of the person or group when it appears in the dropdown list. Repeat to add more people or groups, then click **Add**. 
   1. To add all users as followers, click **Add all users** in the **Add followers** window, then click **Add**.
6. To remove a follower, hover over their name, and then click **Remove** when it appears on the right. Click **Confirm** in the **Remove followers** pop-up window that appears.
   1. To remove multiple followers at once, select the checkboxes to the left of multiple followers, OR click the arrow beside the top checkbox and choose to select either all followers listed on the current page or all followers. Click **Remove \(\# of followers\)** at the top of the list. Click **Confirm** in the **Remove followers** pop-up window that appears.
7. The list of followers will update as you add or remove followers.
8. To manage followers on a different page, click the **X** beside the current page name at the top of the page and start again at Step 2.

Note that adding a group as followers on a page is a one-time action that adds all current group members as individual followers on the page. Future changes to the group membership will not affect followers on the page.
