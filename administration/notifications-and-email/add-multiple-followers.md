# Add multiple followers

You can add followers to a page so that they will be notified of changes to that page. See the page [Overview of following and notification alerts](../../using-thoughtfarmer/basic-features/following-and-alerts/) to learn about following and how to add individual followers to a page.  
  
If you want to add many followers to a page at once, use the **Bulk manage following** page on the administration panel.

### Add followers to a page in bulk

1. Go to the **Administration panel**: **Content** section &gt; **Bulk manage following** page.
2. Put your cursor in the **Show following list for** text box, and start typing the name of the page you want to add followers to.
3. Click on the page name when it appears in the dropdown menu. A list of the current page followers will appear.
4. To add \(or remove\) followers, click **Bulk update** at the top right of the list. The **Bulk manage following** dialog will appear.
5. In the dialog, drag and drop names from the **All people** column to the **Following** column to add followers. Do the reverse to remove followers.
   1. To select multiple consecutive names: Click on the first name, then hold the SHIFT key and click on the last name.
   2. To select multiple non-consecutive names: Click on the first name, then hold the CTRL key and click on each name you want to select.
   3. Once multiple names are selected, click on any of the selected names to drag-and-drop the entire selected group to another column.
   4. To find a particular person, start typing the name in the search box at the top of the dialog to bring up matching names in all columns.
   5. To add or remove all followers, click on the **Bulk operations** button in the dialog, and select **Set all people to following** or **Clear all following**.
6. Click **Save** when you are done. The list of the current page followers will update.
