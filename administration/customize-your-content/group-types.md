# Group types

## Configure group types

Group Types are a configurable set of classifications that can be assigned to any group. This allows for further refinement of searches on the Group Directory. Any time a group is created or edited it can be classified as a certain type. By default ThoughtFarmer comes with the following group types available:

* Group
* Location
* Department
* Team
* Project
* Business Unit

Profile pages show a list of groups that a user belongs to.
