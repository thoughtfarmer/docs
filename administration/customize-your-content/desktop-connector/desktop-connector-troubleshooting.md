# Desktop Connector Troubleshooting



### Errors installing the Desktop Connector

When you use the _open for editing_ feature in ThoughtFarmer the installation \(or upgrade\) of the Desktop Connector will be triggered on demand if you are not already on the latest version. In most cases the installation should proceed without issues. If you do run into any errors please check the following:

1. You have administrator privileges to your workstation and are allowed to install applications. Otherwise, you will need to get a network administrator to install the ThoughtFarmer Desktop connector manually.
2. If you have a previous copy of the ThoughtFarmer DC and the upgrade does not succeed, uninstall that version and try again.
