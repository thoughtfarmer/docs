# Image browser settings

The image browser, or Choose Image window, displays when you go to add an image to the page body, page header or thumbnail of an intranet page. Image libraries allow users to select images from galleries on the intranet. Users can pick from galleries recommended by administrators, and if enabled, they can search through any of the galleries that they have view permissions on.

### Admins choose Recommended galleries

Administrators can select certain photo galleries to appear in the Recommended galleries section of the image browser. The Recommended galleries section appears above All galleries, and can feature curated galleries of top-notch images that you want your users to be using on their pages.  
To set a gallery as a Recommended gallery:

1. Go into edit mode on the gallery page.
2. Select the checkbox **Set as a recommended gallery** under the page title.
3. Click **Save** on the right side of the page.

Now the gallery will appear in the Recommended galleries section of the image browser when a user adds an image to a page.

### Page header and gallery settings

Administrators can choose whether users can edit page header backgrounds and whether users can add images to page headers. If users are not permitted to add images to page headers, color gradient backgrounds are available for them to select.  
  
To change page header settings:

1. Go to the **Administration panel**: **Content** section &gt; **Files and images** page.
2. Find the **Image browser settings** section.
3. To allow users to edit page header backgrounds, select the checkbox **Enable ability to edit page header backgrounds**.
4. To allow users to use images as page header backgrounds, select the checkbox **Enable images to be used as page header backgrounds**.
5. Click **Save** at the bottom of the page.

Administrators can also choose whether users can add images to a page from any gallery that they have permission to view.  
  
To change gallery settings:

1. Go to the **Administration panel**: **Content** section &gt; **Files and images** page.
2. Find the **Image browser settings** section.
3. To allow users to select images from all galleries, select the checkbox **Enable all viewable photo galleries as sources when adding images**.
4. Click **Save** at the bottom of the page.
