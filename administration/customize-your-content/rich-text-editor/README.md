### Rich Text Editor

ThoughtFarmer uses the [CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/) Rich Text Editor. Content can be added in the regular WYSIWYG design portion or as HTML. This section discusses the ThoughtFarmer supported features of the CKEditor and its custom extensions.

Web based rich text editors behave differently than desktop ones. Users need to be aware of differences they may experience based on browser and format of content. Wikipedia has a brief [outline of web-based rich text editors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_rich-text_editor).
