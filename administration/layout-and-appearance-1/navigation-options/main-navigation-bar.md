### What is the Main Navigation Bar?

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/1%20%28120%29.jpg)



The Main Navigation Bar is the toolbar that appears on every intranet page, below the intranet logo/name, and above any page content. The Main Navigation Bar does not show when viewing the intranet on smartphones, or in some orientations on tablets. The instructions below explain how to control which links show in your intranet's Main Navigation Bar. You can show or hide links to the homepage, users' profile pages, and all top level pages.  
  
To customize the appearance of the main navigation bar, see [customize main navigation](https://community.thoughtfarmer.com/content/105927).

### Show/hide link to homepage in the Main Navigation Bar <a id="section2"></a>

The homepage is accessible by clicking the home icon on the left of the Application Toolbar. A link to the homepage does not show in the Main Navigation Bar by default, but you can choose to display it there. To display the homepage link:

1. Click on the **gear icon** on the right of the Main Navigation Bar.
2. Click on **Edit homepage** in the menu that opens.
3. At the top of the page, for the checkbox "Display \(Homepage name\) in the top navigation bar":
   1. **Check** the checkbox **to show** the link to the homepage.â€‹
   2. **Uncheck** the checkbox **to hide** the link to the homepage.
4. Click **Save** on the top right.

### Show/hide link to a user's profile page in the Main Navigation Bar <a id="section2"></a>

Users are always able to access their profiles from the right of the Application Toolbar by clicking on their profile photo or name and selecting **View profile**. You can also make users' profiles available from the Main Navigation Bar via a personalized link \(For example, "Carolien's Profile"\), but this is not enabled by default. To show the link:

1. Click on the **gear icon** on the right of the Main Navigation Bar.
2. Click on E**dit homepage** in the menu that opens.
3. Under the **Homepage** heading, for the checkbox "Show a link to the user's profile page in the top navigation":
   1. **Check** the checkbox **to show** the link to the user's profile page.
   2. **Uncheck** the checkbox **to hide** the link to the user's profile page.
4. Click **Save** on the top right.

### Enable dropdown menus in the Main Navigation Bar

Administrators can enable dropdown menus that list the child pages for pages listed in the Main Navigation Bar. The dropdown menus open when a cursor hovers over a tab in the Main Navigation Bar.

1. Click on the **gear icon** on the right of the Main Navigation Bar.
2. Click on **Edit homepage** in the menu that opens.
3. Under the **Homepage** heading, for the checkbox "Enable drop-down menus in the top navigation":
   1. **Check** the checkbox **to enable** dropdown menus.
   2. **Uncheck** the checkbox **to disable** dropdown menus.
4. Click **Save** on the top right.

### Show/hide link to top level pages in the Main Navigation Bar

A top level page is a child page of the intranet homepage. When a top level page is created, by default the page shows as a link in the Main Navigation Bar. If you have many top level pages, you may not want them all to appear on the Main Navigation Bar. Too many pages results in the Main Navigation Bar wrapping to the next line, and can look cluttered. Hiding some of the top level links solves this problem. If you hide a top level page from the Main Navigation Bar, it is still accessible in the Left hand Navigation \(if you have chosen to display this feature on desktop\).  
  
To hide a top level page link:

1. Go into edit mode on the top level page that you want to hide.
2. Uncheck the box "Display _\(page name\)_ in the top navigation bar" at the top of the page.
3. Click **Save**.

You can also hide the default People, Groups and News pages from the SuperNav instead of the Main Navigation Bar. To learn more see [SuperNav settings](supernav-setting.md).
