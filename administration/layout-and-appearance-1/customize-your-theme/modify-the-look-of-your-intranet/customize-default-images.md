# Customize default images

### Customize default images using the Theme page

If a user has not added a profile picture, or a group page has no images added to it, default profile and group images will display on profile pages, in the Employee Directory and the Group Directory. Under the **Default images** tab, you can choose your own default images for these areas.

### Profile image

* **Default profile image**: Upload an image that will appear on profile pages and the Employee Directory when a user has not uploaded a profile picture. The image must be a minimum of 500px width and height. If you don't upload an image, the user's initials will show as their profile image.

### Group image

* **Default profile image**: Upload an image that will appear on the Group Directory when a group page has no image added to it or set as the thumbnail image. The image must be a minimum of 500px width and height.
