# Customize fonts and headings

### Customize fonts & headings using the Theme page

The **Fonts & headings** section allows you to change the font families and colors of text throughout the site. Font colors can be customized for various types of text \(e.g. links, page body, future/private indicators\).

### Font family

There are 10 font families available:

* Fira Sans, Lucida Sans, Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Dejavu Sans, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif
* Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif
* Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif
* Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial
* Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans, Arial, sans-serif
* Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif
* Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif
* Palatino Linotype, Book Antiqua, Palatino, Times New Roman, Times, serif
* Trebuchet MS, Lucida Sans, Arial, sans-serif
* Verdana, Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif

These function as a priority sequence of fonts to display to the user. If the first is not available on a user's computer then the next available in the list will be presented.  
  
You can further customize your intranet by adding additional web fonts. See [add custom web fonts](../add-custom-web-fonts.md) for more information.

### Font colors

Colors can be specified by entering the HEX value for the desired color \(please see [HTML Colors](http://www.w3schools.com/Html/html_colors.asp) for more info\). You can also create your own custom colors by clicking on the currently chosen one associated with a particular field. This will bring up the color customizer.

### Page headings

Under this heading you can specify the font family, color, and weight of page headings. This applies to the title of pages only when viewing a page \(not in navigation or news\), and to user names when on a profile page.

### Page header gradients

The Page header gradient shows on pages where no page header image has been added. You can add multiple different gradient start and end colours for users to choose from on Edit page. The first gradient of the four will be the default gradient used when no page header image has been added.
