# Page header images

## Page header images

You can add visual interest and either uniqueness or continuity to pages by adding a page header image. The page header is the area below the Main Navigation Bar that contains the page title, Add, Edit and Page Sharing Buttons. If you click the down arrow on the right of the page header, it expands to reveal the Page Controls area. A unique page header image can make a page stand out from other pages on the intranet. The same page header applied throughout a section of the intranet can lend continuity to a department's pages, or to information related to the same topic. Page header images can be used to good effect for different purposes.  
  
Pages by default have the same page header image/gradient that is found on their parent page. Once the page header image on a page is changed, it is no longer affected by changes to the parent page's page header image.  
  
See [Page header image guidelines](page-header-image-guidlines.md) for information on selecting the best page header images for your purposes. For user information about applying page headers see [Add page header images](../../../../../using-thoughtfarmer/edit-page-contents/add-page-header-images.md).  
  
See also [Image size guidelines](../image-size-guidlines.md) for recommended image sizes for all images used in ThoughtFarmer.
