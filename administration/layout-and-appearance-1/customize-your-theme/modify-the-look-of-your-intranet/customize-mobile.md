# Customize mobile



### Customize options for bookmarking site on mobile

If you have not done so already, you can [set your site up to support mobile](../../../mobile/). Since ThoughtFarmer is responsive to the screen size of the device it is being viewed on, the Theme choices you have made for your intranet as a whole will be seen when viewing the site on a mobile device. However, you can set the default name and icon that will be used when a user adds a bookmark for the intranet site to the home screen of their mobile device 

### Home screen

Some mobile devices allow you to bookmark your application onto the Home screen, allowing for more direct access to it.![6.7Admin8729HomeScreenBookmark.png](https://community.thoughtfarmer.com/imagethumb/11754230000/16632/600x600/False/6.7Admin8729HomeScreenBookmark.png)
