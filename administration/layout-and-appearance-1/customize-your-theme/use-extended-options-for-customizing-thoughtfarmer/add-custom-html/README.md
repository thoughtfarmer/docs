### Custom header HTML

If you wish to add content to the header section of your ThoughtFarmer intranet then you can insert it in the Custom Header HTML section. This is the ideal location for adding custom buttons for navigation.

### Custom footer HTML

To add content to the footer of every ThoughtFarmer page you can add it in the Custom footer HTML section of the Theme page. This is also the ideal location for extra scripts like Google Analytics or any DOM manipulation scripts that require elements to be loaded and ready.
