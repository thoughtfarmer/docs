# Use extended options for customizing ThoughtFarmer



### Use extended options for customizing ThoughtFarmer using CSS, XHTML and JavaScript

Certain desired customizations may go beyond the default options available on the Theme page. ThoughtFarmer is able to inject any custom XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript directly into key portions of the page to get the customization that you want. Add these customizations on the Theme page, under the **Custom HTML** or **CSS & Javascript** tabs.  
  
In addition to style customizations, you can also use this section to add references to third party libraries \(e.g. [Lightbox](http://www.lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/?u=9), [SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/)\), or embed tracking code such as [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/). Customizations using ThoughtFarmer CSS hooks are not guaranteed to be maintained after version upgrades. It is recommended that any customizations be tested after upgrades and modified if necessary.

### How do I?
