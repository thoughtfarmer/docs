# Add custom CSS and JavaScript



### How to add custom CSS and JavaScript

You can make modifications to your ThoughtFarmer intranet using extra CSS and Javascript code. These modifications are made in the **Custom CSS** and **Custom JavaScript** areas, found under the **CSS & JavaScript** tab of the **Theme** page.

### Add custom CSS

You can add custom CSS to your intranet from the Theme page, allowing you to customize your intranet's visual elements. You do not have to surround your code in &lt;style&gt; tags in this area. You are able to add CSS either directly inline or through link references to CSS pages available externally or uploaded to another ThoughtFarmer page. If you want to make any external &lt;link&gt; file references, add those to the Extra &lt;HEAD&gt; tag content section of the Custom HTML tab.

1. Go to the **Administration panel** &gt; **User interface** section &gt; **Theme** page.
2. Select the **CSS & Javascript** tab.
3. Enter custom CSS in the **Custom CSS** field.

### Add custom JavaScript

You can add custom JavaScript to your intranet from the Theme page. ThoughtFarmer uses jQuery and it is included on every page, so it does not need to be re-referenced to be used. Similar to the CSS tab, you are not required to surround your code with a &lt;script&gt; tag in this area. If you want to make any external &lt;script&gt; file references, add those to the Custom footer HTML section of the Custom HTML tab.

1. Go to the **Administration panel** &gt; **User interface** section &gt; **Theme** page.
2. Select the **CSS & Javascript** tab.
3. Enter custom JavaScript in the **Custom JavaScript** field.
