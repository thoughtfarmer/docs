# Customize your Theme



### Customize the look of your intranet

The **Theme** page is used to customize the look and feel of your ThoughtFarmer Intranet. You can find the **Theme** page in the **User Interface** section of the **Administration Panel**. On this page you will find a variety of tabs for all of the major components of the user interface. There are also tabs that allow you to add custom HTML, CSS, or even JavaScript to every ThoughtFarmer page. This allows for customizations well beyond the scope of the regular Theme options. You can also export Themes that you have created, and import new Themes.
