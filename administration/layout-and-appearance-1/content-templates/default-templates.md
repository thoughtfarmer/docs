# Default templates

In a fresh install of ThoughtFarmer, each content type comes with one or more default templates pre-populated with Cards. Group and section content types come with multiple default templates. The default templates can be used as is, or administrators can make changes to them.   
  
Attached to this page is an Excel spreadsheet that shows which Cards are found in the default templates.  
  
"Default templates" here refers to the templates that come out-of-the-box for use with ThoughtFarmer. "Default template" can also refer to the specific template that an administrator can select as the default for a particular content type. This is the template that is automatically selected when a user chooses a particular content type when creating or editing a page. To learn more, see the heading **Select default template for content type** on the page [Create and modify templates](create-and-modify-template/).
