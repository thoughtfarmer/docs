# News carousel Card

### Set up a News carousel on the homepage <a id="section2"></a>

News Carousels draw a lot of attention by rotating through a series of News posts, images and videos. You can select the number of posts that will appear in a carousel rotation. Viewers can hover over the carousel to pause the rotation, and can navigate from post to post using the arrows that appear on hover, or the circles below the carousel that represent each post. If a news post contains a video, users can view the video right from the carousel.

You can adjust the speed of the carousel rotation, and choose to rotate the carousel continuously using configuration settings. See [change carousel rotation options](../../../advanced-configuration/configuration-settings/change-carousel-rotation-options.md) to learn about these configuration settings.

### Image size for carousel posts

Posts that will be shown in the carousel should include a Thumbnail image that is large, wide, and high quality, to look their best. The Thumbnail image for the post will be the background for the post in the carousel, with the title and summary of the post overlaid onto the image. For recommended image sizes for News carousel posts, see[ News display options](news-cards/news-display-options.md) or[ Image size guidelines](../../customize-your-theme/modify-the-look-of-your-intranet/image-size-guidlines.md).

### Videos in carousel posts

If a news post that feeds into a carousel has a video embedded in it, users can play the video right from the carousel. Video posts will show a thumbnail image from the video in the carousel, with a play button overlaid.
