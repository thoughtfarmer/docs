# Set up a News Card



### Find or create News sources

To add any News items to the homepage, the News sources have to exist somewhere else first. It could be the intranet's default news page that you are adding as a source, or it could be a news, blog or forum page that has been created on the intranet. If an external website \(such as a blog or forum\) produces an RSS feed, you can add it as a source and have content from it show on the intranet's homepage. It doesn't matter if the source you're adding doesn't have any posts on it yet, you can still add it as a news source on the homepage. Just keep in mind that you won't see any posts from that source on the homepage until posts are created on the original page.  
  
You can add calendar sources to your homepage news, but they will only display if the **Items grouped by source option** is selected. Learn about [homepage news groupings and order](homepage-news-grouping-and-order.md).
