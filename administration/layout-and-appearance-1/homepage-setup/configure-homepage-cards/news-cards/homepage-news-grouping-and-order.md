# Homepage News grouping and order



### Homepage News grouping and order options <a id="section7"></a>

There are two options for how news information is grouped in Recent News. This is true whether you are using the Grid or List display style.

* **Items grouped by source**: This option separates each news source into its own section. News from all of a user's groups shows in one section. The number of items from each news page can be configured separately with this option.
* **Merge sources to show newest item on top**: This shows news items from all sources in the same section. This includes news items directed to all users, and news from users' groups. The newest item always shows on top, and you can select the total number of items to display.

Calendars will display in a News Card only if the option **Items grouped by source is selected**.  
  
In a News Carousel, multiple sources are always merged to show newest items first.
