# Poll Card

### Set up a Poll Card to get instant feedback from intranet users

A Poll Card is a way to engage users on the homepage and let them express their opinions and give you useful feedback. When you add a Poll Card, you can choose to have it display the most recently created poll on the intranet, or a specific poll that you select.
