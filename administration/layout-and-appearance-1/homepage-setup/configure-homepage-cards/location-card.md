# Location card

### Set up a Location Card on the homepage

You can add a Location Card to make contact information and a map available on your homepage. If you have colleagues in disparate locations, a Location Card with HQ's information may be useful. Colleagues visiting from out of town can find their way to the main office by viewing the map on the homepage.
