# Rich Text Card

### Set up a Rich Text Card on the homepage <a id="pageTitle_en"></a>

Adding content to a Rich Text Card is just like using the Rich Text Editor that you use when editing a page on the intranet. Rich text Cards can contain localized content for each of the enabled languages on your intranet.  
  
Rich Text Cards can be used for many things. A Rich Text card at the top of the center column on the homepage can display information that you want to be highly visible, like an outage announcement. Rich Text Cards can also be used for supplemental information, links, or widgets.
