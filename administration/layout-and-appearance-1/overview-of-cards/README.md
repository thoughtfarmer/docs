# Overview of Cards

### What are Cards?

Cards are like the building blocks of a page. When you look at a page on your intranet, each of its different components is a Card. They come in different shapes and sizes, depending on their content, their location on the page, and the device you are viewing the page on - but each Card contains a different page feature. Examples of some features found in Cards are Body \(content\), News, Activity stream, Document library, Comments, Navigation, Mini calendar, Current poll, and Quick links. Even the left hand SuperNav and the Page Header are technically their own Cards, although they live in specific locations on the page.

You can see how all of these building blocks stacked together makes up a page. Because page creators can choose which Cards to use on a page, each page can be different and uniquely suited to its purpose. The intranet administrator can also create a unique and useful homepage with their selection and set up of Cards.

### Templates are made up of Cards

Your ThoughtFarmer intranet comes with default templates for different content types, each containing Cards that are useful for a content type. The intranet administrator can customize templates to suit your organization. \(To learn more, see [Content type templates](../content-templates/).\) When a user creates a page, they find that the template is pre-populated with different Cards, or page features. Some Cards have to be set up, or filled with content, in order for them to display on the completed page. \(To learn more, see [How to set up Cards on a page](../../../using-thoughtfarmer/add-pages-and-sections/set-up-cards/).\)  
  
Depending on the level of permission a user has been granted, they may also have the ability to further customize a page by adding Cards that are not part of the template, or moving and reordering Cards. Administrators in admin mode can always modify the Cards on a specific page. \(To learn more about customizing the Cards on a page, see [How to modify templates](../../../using-thoughtfarmer/add-pages-and-sections/modify-templates.md).\)
