* **Translate:** When the Translate Card is set to Automatic in the Administration panel, pages that have a Translate Card on them and are not in a user's default language, are automatically translated. When the Translate Card is set to Manual in the Administration panel, users must click **Translate** in the Translate Card to have the page translated.
* **Your groups:** Displays a list of links to all the groups a user belongs to. Users can go to the group page by clicking on the group, and can also navigate through the subpages of the groups within the card.
