# Random Quote

### Manage the Random Quote Card

The Random Quote feature of ThoughtFarmer allows users to add their favorite quotes to share with others. When enabled, user-added quotes will show wherever the Random Quote Card is added to a page. Every page refresh on a page with the Quotes Card will present a new randomly selected quote. Users can also navigate through the quotes using the arrows on the Random Quote Card.
