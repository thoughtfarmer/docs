# ThoughtFarmer Analytics



### ThoughtFarmer Analytics

ThoughtFarmer Analytics is an analytics package dedicated to intranets. Traditional analytics packages assume that you don’t know the names of your visitors, and they do a poor job of distinguishing between visitors coming from a single shared Internet connection.ThoughtFarmer Analytics differs from traditional analytics software in that it tracks more metrics about your visitors \(such as their names and departments\), and also tracks key social intranet metrics \(such as page edits, page creation, and comments\). Custom reports modeled after ThoughtFarmer’s tree navigation structure also allow you to track visitors according to your site’s own Information Architecture.
