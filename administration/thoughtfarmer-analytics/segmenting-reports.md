# Segmenting Reports

### About segments

ThoughtFarmer Analytics normally displays the visit data in aggregate in order to provide you with a general overview of your site's visitor traffic.  
  
On the other hand, a segment is a subset of the visit data that is tailored for your needs. Segmented reports contain only a part of the entire set of visits tracked by ThoughtFarmer Analytics. Segments allow for defining of filters and criteria set to display data that is relevant for your reporting needs.  
  
For example, using segments you can display reports only from a specific location \(e.g. city, country\), or you can display pages that have a specific url part, or users with a specific department.

### Creating Segments

In order to create segments you need to click the **All Visits** tab that is located besides the date picker. From there, you need to click the **Add New Segment** button.
