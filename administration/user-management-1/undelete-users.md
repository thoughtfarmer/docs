# Undelete users

Though this action is rarely taken, a user who has been deleted can be undeleted. When a user is undeleted, their status is set to inactive.

1. Go to the ThoughtFarmer **Administration Panel**: **Users & security** section &gt; **User management** page.
2. Use the filter, sort, and query tools to find the desired user or set of users \(see [Find users](find-users.md) for more info\). To see a list of deleted users, click the **Deleted** filter under the **Account status** heading.
3. Select the checkbox beside the desired user\(s\).
4. In the "Choose an action..." dropdown select **Undelete user**.
5. Click **Go**.
