# Cancel and resend invitations



### How to cancel and resend invitations to users

If a Regular user does not receive a sent invitation you will need to cancel the invitation before you can send out a new one. You may also need to cancel an invitation if you wish to activate the user by another method. If a user does not activate the account before the invitation expiry, they will show as "Expired" on the [User Management](./) page. You must then resend an invitation.

If a user does not receive invitations repeatedly, check to ensure that the email is not being blocked or ending up in a Junk folder. Their inbox should be configured to allow emails from the configured [outgoing email](../notifications-and-email/outgoing-email.md) address.

### Cancel an invitation

1.Go to the ThoughtFarmer **Administration Panel**: **Users & security** section &gt; **User management** page.

2.Use the filter, sort, and query tools to find the desired user or set of users \(see [Find users](find-users.md) for more info\). The user must have status "Invited" or "Expired".

3.Click the gear icon in the **Action** column to the right of the user, and click **Edit account** in the menu that opens.
