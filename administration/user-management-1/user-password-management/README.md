# User password management



### User password management

ThoughtFarmer Regular and Active Directory users are able to manage their own passwords and change them before a password expiry is set to occur. This feature is always available for Regular users. It must be configured and enabled for Active Directory users.  
  
The Change password link is available to a user by clicking on their name or profile photo on the top right of the Application Toolbar. In the dropdown menu that opens, the user can click Change Password.  
  
Users can also access the Change password link from their profile page by clicking the down arrow on the right and then clicking Change password.
