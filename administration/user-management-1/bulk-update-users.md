# Bulk update users



If you need to change a lot of user information at once, use the **Bulk export users** and **Bulk update users** features to export the information into an Excel sheet for easy updating and importing.

### Bulk update Regular user information

In order to update user information in bulk, you must export the existing user information into an Excel file. The maximum number of users that you can upload at a time is 500, so apply filters on the User management screen to preform a partial export if necessary.

1.Go to the **Administration panel**: **Users & security** section &gt; **User management** page.

2.Use the filter, sort, and query tools to find the desired set of users \(see [Find users](find-users.md) for more info\).

3.Click **Bulk export filtered users** in the top right.
