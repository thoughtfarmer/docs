# Make a user an administrator

### How to make a user a ThoughtFarmer administrator

Giving a user administrator access means they can access the Administration panel and perform any task there. It also means they can bypass all security on pages throughout ThoughtFarmer when they enter "Admin mode". To see who has administrator access and to manage the site administrator, please see [Manage administrators](manage-administrators.md).

### Access Admin mode and Admin panel

To access the Administration panel or enter Admin Mode, click on **your name or profile photo** in the top right of the Application Toolbar. In the menu that opens, click on the **toggle** beside **Admin Mode** to switch it to **ON**and view the site as an administrator. In that same menu, click **Administration panel** to go to the Administration panel - it is not necessary to have Admin Mode ON to go to the Administration panel.
