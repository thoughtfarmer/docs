# Convert user account types



### How to convert user account types

In an Active Directory environment you may have a mix of user types. You may wish to convert a Regular user to an Active Directory user if you want to add them to AD security and distribution groups.  
  
You can also switch an AD user to a Regular user. This may be beneficial as you will no longer require an additional Microsoft Client Access license for that user. This section goes over the steps required for these conversion scenarios.
