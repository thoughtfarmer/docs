# Create External users



Create an external user when you want a user to be able to use third-party credentials \(eg. from Salesforce or ZenDesk\) to log in to the intranet.

#### Before you begin

Please contact ThoughtFarmer support to discuss using External users before following these instructions.  
  
Ensure that there is a Custom SAML external login provider added for the third-party application that your External users will sign in through. Configure the third-party application to use SAML sign in.

### Create External users

1. Go to the **Administration panel: Users & security** section &gt; **Create user** page.
2. In the **Account Type** section select the radio button for "External user".
3. Enter the desired **username** in the provided text field.
4. Enter the user's account information in the provided text fields \(First and last name are required at a minimum\).
5. Click **Create user** at the bottom of the page.
