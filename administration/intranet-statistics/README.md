# Intranet statistics



### Intranet Statistics

Intranet Statistics is the first analytics package dedicated to intranets. Traditional analytics packages assume that you don’t know the names of your visitors, and they do a poor job of distinguishing between visitors coming from a single shared Internet connection.Intranet Statistics tracks your visitors by name, and also tracks key social intranet metrics such as page edits, page creation, and comments. Custom reports modeled after ThoughtFarmer’s wiki tree structure also allow you to track visitors according to your site’s own information architecture.
