# Leaderboard

### Leaderboard

The Leaderboard is an informational page that lets you view several summaries of activity on your intranet. It gives you a current report of the type of content your intranet contains, the most prolific users, and the most popular content and search terms. The statistics on the Leaderboard page are updated instantly based on user actions like creating a page, or performing a search. Here you can keep track of the growth of your intranet, and who is contributing greatly to that growth.  
  
The Leaderboard page is found by going to the **Administration panel**: **Logs & statistics** section &gt; **Leaderboard**page. It contains the following sections:
