# Language localization

### Language localization

ThoughtFarmer can be localized to suit a user's preferred language. For each language that is enabled on the site, users have the option to view and add content in that language. Users can choose one of the enabled languages as their default, and this determines the localized user interface that is presented to them. If content is available in a user's chosen default language, it will display for them automatically. Content not available in that language will appear in the site default language.
