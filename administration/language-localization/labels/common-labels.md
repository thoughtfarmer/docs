| DesktopConnectorTourPage1Body | &lt;p&gt;                The &lt;strong&gt;Desktop Connector&lt;/strong&gt; is an application that connects your intranet and your computer.                It lets you &lt;strong&gt;open and edit&lt;/strong&gt; files from the intranet, and save new file versions back to the intranet.            &lt;/p&gt;            &lt;p&gt;                When you have a file open for editing, the Desktop Connector locks the file on the intranet,                so no one else can edit it at the same time. That way nobody duplicates your work or creates multiple file versions.            &lt;/p&gt; |
| DesktopConnectorTourPage1Title | What is the Desktop Connector? |
| DesktopConnectorTourPage2Body | &lt;p&gt;                The Desktop Connector &lt;strong&gt;works behind the scenes&lt;/strong&gt; to keep it simple for you to edit files from your intranet.            &lt;/p&gt;            &lt;p&gt;                Locate the file on your intranet and click "Open for editing". The Desktop Connector opens the file for you in the program you need, and you're ready to work. Make changes to the file just like you would to any file on your computer.            &lt;/p&gt; |
| DesktopConnectorTourPage2Title | How it works |
| DesktopConnectorTourPage3Body | &lt;p&gt;                When you're done editing the file, save it and close it. Click "Done editing" on the file's intranet page. The new version of the file is &lt;strong&gt;automatically uploaded&lt;/strong&gt; to your intranet, ready for the next person to view, edit or download.            &lt;/p&gt; |

The powerful features on Edit Page are the building blocks of your intranet, so learn how to use them                and see what you can create!            &lt;/p&gt;            &lt;p&gt;                Let us give you a quick overview of the features, then try them out for yourself.            &lt;/p&gt; |
| EditContentTourPage1Title | Welcome |
| EditContentTourPage2Body | &lt;p&gt;                Make your page title brief but descriptive. It appears in several places &\#8212;                at the top of your page, in search results, in activity streams, and more.            &lt;/p&gt;            &lt;p&gt;                Add the body content of your page in the &lt;strong&gt;Rich Text Editor&lt;/strong&gt; window. The Rich Text Editor controls are similar to those found in popular word processing programs.                Use them to add text formatting; to insert images, videos, and other media; and to add tables.            &lt;/p&gt;            &lt;p&gt;                &lt;img src="/assets/img/tour/edit/language-toggles.png" class="photoLeft" /&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;language icons&lt;/strong&gt; in the top right to create your page in multiple languages.            &lt;/p&gt;            &lt;p&gt;                &lt;strong&gt;Familiar with HTML?&lt;/strong&gt; Click the Source button in the Rich Text Editor if you want to create your page using code.            &lt;/p&gt; |

Subscribe to content from other intranet pages or external sites.                Select the "Private" checkbox if you want your page to be visible only to you and your intranet administrator.            &lt;/p&gt;            &lt;p&gt;                Don't be afraid to experiment with options on Edit Page to learn all the things you can do! &lt;strong&gt;When you're done, click Publish!&lt;/strong&gt;            &lt;/p&gt;            &lt;p&gt;                &lt;a href="\#" id="getStarted"&gt;Let's get started!&lt;/a&gt;            &lt;/p&gt; |
