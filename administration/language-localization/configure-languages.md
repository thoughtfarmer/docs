# Configure Languages



### Enable an available language

On a fresh install ThoughtFarmer comes with only English enabled and set as the default language. Enabled languages also affect the auto-translate options available. To enable a language:

1.Go to the **Administration Panel**: **User interface** section &gt; **Languages** page.

2.Click **Add language** on the right.

3.Click on the **Choose language...** field to open the dropdown and select the language you want to enable.

4.Click **Add**. The new language will be added to the list of Configured languages.

### Change the default language

Selecting a default language implies that most of the content within the site will be available in that language. If content is not available in the user's default language then ThoughtFarmer checks for content available in other languages. The site's default language will have priority.

1. Go to the **Administration Panel**: **User interface** section &gt; **Languages** page.
2. Click the radio button in the **Default** column beside the language you want to select.
3. Click **OK** to confirm the change.

### Disable an available language

Disabling a language does not delete any of the content entered for it. It does disable it from being viewed from within ThoughtFarmer. If a hidden language is later added back into the list of configured languages any content previously entered will also become available.

1.Go to the **Administration Panel**: **User interface** section &gt; **Languages** page.

2.Select the checkbox beside each language you want to disable.

3.Click **Delete checked**.

4.Click **OK** to confirm the deletion.

5.Go to the **Administration Panel**: **Search** section &gt; **Search Index** page.

6.Click **Rebuild search index**.

Rebuilding the search index after disabling a language will ensure that it will no longer be included in search results.
