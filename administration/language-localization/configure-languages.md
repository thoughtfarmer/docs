# Configure Languages

## Enable an available language

On a fresh install ThoughtFarmer comes with only English enabled and set as the default language. Enabled languages also affect the auto-translate options available. To enable a language:

## Change the default language

Selecting a default language implies that most of the content within the site will be available in that language. If content is not available in the user's default language then ThoughtFarmer checks for content available in other languages. The site's default language will have priority.

1. Go to the **Admin Panel**: **User interface** section &gt; **Languages** page.
2. Hover over the language that you want to make the default.
3. Click on **Set as default** that appears on the right.
4. Click **Change** in the Change default language window to confirm the selection.

## Disable an available language

Disabling a language does not delete any of the content entered for it. It does disable it from being viewed from within ThoughtFarmer. If a hidden language is later added back into the list of configured languages any content previously entered will also become available.

1. Go to the **Admin Panel**: **User interface** section &gt; **Languages** page.
2. Click the **toggle** on the left of the language you want to enable to turn it to **ON**.
3. Repeat to enable more languages.

Rebuilding the search index after disabling a language will ensure that it will no longer be included in search results.

1. Go to the **Admin Panel**: **User interface** section &gt; **Languages** page.
2. Click the **toggle** on the left of the language you want to disable to turn it to **OFF**.
3. Click **Turn off** in the Turn off language window to confirm.
4. Go to the **Admin panel**: **Search** section &gt; **Search settings** page.
5. Under the **index** tab, click **Rebuild index**.
