# Maintain the intranet



### Keep the intranet current

Intranets require maintenance to stay current with changes in your organization. Learn how to change the owner of many pages at once; restore, archive and delete content; and upload many documents at once.

### How do I?

* [Change page ownership for multiple pages](change-owner.md)
* [Archive or delete content](archive-or-delete-stale-content.md)
* [Restore content](restore-content.md)
* [Purge deleted information](purge-deleted-information.md)
* [Use our Bulk File Uploader](bulk-uploader-for-windows/)
