# Change owner

### How to change the ownership of multiple pages

Use these instructions to change ownership of some or all of a user's content. This feature is useful when a person changes to a new position within an organization, or leaves the company. When pages have a new owner assigned, that user automatically follows those pages, so they don't miss out on comments and changes.

### Find all content owned by a user

1. Go to the **Administration panel**: **Content** section &gt; **Change owner** page.
2. Start typing the name of the current owner in the **Current owner** box.![6.7Admin8810CurrentOwner.png](https://community.thoughtfarmer.com/imagethumb/862517370000/16621/600x600/False/6.7Admin8810CurrentOwner.png)
3. Click once on the current owner from the list that drops down.
4. Click the **Find content** button.

### Select content to be changed to new owner

After following the four steps above, all content for the current owner will display in two ways. On the left, an expandable tree navigation of the site shows the sections containing pages owned by the selected current owner. Titles of pages owned by the selected current owner appear as links which you can click to view the page in a new tab. On the right, you can scroll through a list of all the current owner's pages that are selected for changing ownership.

1.To change ownership of all of the user's pages, skip to **Step 4** \(as all the user's pages are selected by default\).

2.To change ownership of only some of the user's pages, uncheck the box at the top left.

3.Navigate through the directory of pages by clicking on the rotating triangles on the left. Hover over sections to see a pop-up telling you how many subpages the user owns in that section. Select only the pages or sections of pages whose ownership you wish to change. The list on the right will automatically refresh showing only the pages that are selected.
