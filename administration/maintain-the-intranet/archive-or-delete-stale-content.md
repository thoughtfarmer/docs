# Archive or delete stale content

### How to archive or delete stale content

Use these instructions to find content on your intranet that hasn't been viewed recently and archive or delete it. The **Archive or delete stale content** page in the **Administration panel** helps you keep your intranet current and uncluttered. For more information about archiving and deleting, see the user instructions on [how to archive and delete a page](../../using-thoughtfarmer/edit-page-contents/archive-and-delete-pages.md).

### Find stale content

In searching for stale content, the default setting is to find pages "viewed fewer than 2 times in the last 6 months", but you can alter these settings and add filters to change the results of your stale content search.

1. Go to the **Administration panel**: **Content** section &gt; **Archive or delete stale content** page.
2. By default, the search parameters will display as "Show pages viewed fewer than **2** times in the last **6months**". If you wish, change the maximum number of page views, and the time period, by entering numbers in the text boxes, and selecting days, months or years from the dropdown.  ![6.7Admin8764FindStaleContent.png](https://community.thoughtfarmer.com/imagethumb/21759230000/16624/541x39/False/6.7Admin8764FindStaleContent.png)

At this point, you can click the **Find stale content** button in the bottom right, or further refine your search following the steps below.

1. **To ignore page views performed by a certain user or users \(perhaps yourself\)**, start typing the name of the user in the **Ignore page views from** box, and click on the user's name in the dropdown that appears. Repeat to add more users.
2. **To show results only from a certain section of the intranet**, start typing the name of that section in the **Show results from** box, and click on the section in the dropdown that appears. If you start typing and select a user's name in this box, it will search content under that user's profile page.
3. **To show results with keywords in the title**, type in the full title of the page you are looking for, or a word you know is in the title of the page.
4. **To include archived content in the search**, select the checkbox to the right of **Show archived content**.
5. Click **Find stale content** to perform the search with the filters you have added.

To clear any of the filters, click the X beside the filter. After performing a stale content search, click **Reset** to the left of the **Find stale content** button to clear all the filters and results and start a new search.

2.Sort the results by clicking on any of the sort options above the results \(**Number of subpages**, **Number of views**, **Date**\). Click on the sort option again to perform the sort in reverse order.

### Exclude pages from the stale content report

If you find a page in the stale content report that is rarely viewed but is still current and valuable information that you want to keep on the intranet, you can choose to exclude it from future stale content reports. Check the box to the left of the page you want to exclude \(this will also select any subpages of this page\), and click the button **Exclude from stale content** at the top of the results. The page and subpages will now be excluded from future stale content results.
