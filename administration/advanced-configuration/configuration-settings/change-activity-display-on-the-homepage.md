# Change Activity display on the homepage

Recent activity displays on the homepage in the Activity Card. You can control the type and amount of activity items that appear in the homepage Activity Card, based on the importance level of different items.  
  
The page [Activity descriptions and their importance](activity-descriptions-and-their-importance.md) shows the importance level assigned to each item of activity on the intranet. For example, creating a page \(activity importance of 5\) is a more significant change than tagging a page \(activity importance of 3\). Use values on the above-mentioned page to alter the configuration setting using the instructions below.
