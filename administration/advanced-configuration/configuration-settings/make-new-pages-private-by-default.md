# Make new pages Private by default



When you add a page, the option exists to check the **Private** box under the **Publish** button. Checking the Private box changes the **Publish** option to **Save**, and the saved page is visible only to you as the owner, and administrators in Admin mode. This is great for content that is still being drafted, or that just isn't ready to be released to the world yet.  
  
By default, when a new page is added, the **Private** checkbox is unchecked, and when published, the new page is public - visible to anyone with View Permission on the page. Administrators can change a configuration setting so that when a new page is added, it defaults to **Private**, with the **Private** box checked. This way, the creator will have to consciously uncheck the box to make a page public.To make this change:  
 

1. Go to the **Administration panel**: **Advanced options** section &gt; **Configuration settings** page.
2. Type **public** in the **Search config settings** field to narrow the config settings results.
3. Find the config setting page.add.defaultPublic.
4. Click in the **Value** column beside the config setting.
   * Select the **false** radio button to make new pages default to Private.  ![8.1Admin16911PrivatePage.jpg](https://community.thoughtfarmer.com/imagethumb/240841070000/16890/287x124/False/8.1Admin16911PrivatePage.jpg)
