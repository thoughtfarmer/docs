# Change carousel rotation options

### Change carousel rotation speed

You can choose how long an item will show in the home page carousel news before auto-advancing to the next item.

1. Go to the **Administration panel**: **Advanced options** section &gt; **Configuration settings** page.
2. Type **carousel** in the **Search config settings** field to narrow the config settings results.
3. Find the config setting home.carousel.autoRotateSpeed.
4. Click in the **Value** column beside the config setting. Enter the time \(in milliseconds\) that you want an item to show in the carousel before advancing to the next item.
5. Click **Save**.

### Make carousel loop continuously

By default, the News Carousel Card loops through all of the news stories it is displaying once, then displays the first story again and remains on the first story unless the user manually navigates to the other stories. You can change a configuration setting so that the carousel continuously loops through stories and does not stop on a story.

1. Go to the **Administration panel**: **Advanced options** section &gt; **Configuration settings** page.
2. Type **carousel** in the **Search config settings** field to narrow the config settings results.
3. Find the config setting news.carousel.loopForever.
4. Click in the **Value** column beside the config setting.
   1. Select the **true** radio button to make the carousel loop continuously.
   2. Select the **false** radio button to make the carousel loop once and then pause on the first story.
5. Click **Save**.
