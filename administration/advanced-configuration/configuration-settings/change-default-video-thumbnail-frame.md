# Change default video thumbnail frame

### Set the timing of the frame used for the video thumbnail

When an attached video file is opened in file preview, or when the video file is embedded in a page, a thumbnail image is used to represent the video. By default, the thumbnail image is the frame that is five seconds into the video. With this configuration setting, you choose the time in the video where the thumbnail image is pulled from.  
  
Example: If you want to use the frame that is 15 seconds into the video as the default thumbnail image, set the value for this configuration setting to 15.
