# Change comment sort order

### Change comment sort order

You can choose whether comments will appear in chronological order with newest comments at the top or oldest comments at the top. This configuration setting will not affect the order of replies on a forum post - which display oldest at the top.

1. Go to the **Administration panel**: **Advanced options** section &gt; **Configuration settings** page.
2. Type **comment** in the **Search config settings** field to narrow the config settings results.

   1. Select **true** if you want newest comments to display at the top.
   2. Select **false** if you want oldest comments to display at the top.
