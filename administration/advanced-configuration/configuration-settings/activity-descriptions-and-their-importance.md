# Activity descriptions and their importance



The higher the Activity Importance number, the more significant the activity is on the intranet. For example, creating a page \(activity importance of 5\) is a more significant change than tagging a page \(activity importance of 3\).  
  
Please see the pages [Change recent activity display on pages](change-activity-display-on-pages.md) and [Change recent activity display on the homepage](change-activity-display-on-pages.md) for information on using activity importance levels to change the recent activity that appears on your intranet.
