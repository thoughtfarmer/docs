# Search and navigation

### Search and navigation

If a user does not have view access to a particular content item, that item does not appear in search results, in navigation, or on the interface in any way. For that user, it is as if the content item does not exist.

Each of the following content areas is displayed according to the current user's security settings:

* Top navigation
* Left navigation Card/SuperNav
* Compact Directory navigation Card
* Grid navigation Card
* One Column navigation Card
* Two Column navigation Card
* Activity Card
* Current poll Card
* Document Library Card
* News Card
* News Carousel Card
* Employee directory
* Group directory
* Search results
* Search results \(free text queries\)
* Search results \(faceted browse/ browse by keyword\)
* List of all polls
* Activity in Page Controls
