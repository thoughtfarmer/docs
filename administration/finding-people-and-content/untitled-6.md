On the Organizational Chart Viewer admin page, you can select who will be at the top of the Org Chart, which person the Org Chart will focus on when opened, how many levels of the Org Chart will show by default, and what information will be displayed about people when you hover over their photo and when you click on it.  
  
In order for the Org Chart to be available for viewing, you need to set who the top level staff member is.

### Set up the Organization Chart Viewer

To access these settings, go to the **Administration Panel**: **Users & security** section &gt; **Organizational Chart Viewer** page.

### Set top level staff

Your top level staff is the person or people who should appear on the top level of the Org Chart Viewer.

1.Go to **Administration Panel**: **Users & security** section &gt; **Organizational Chart Viewer** page.

2.Click in the box under **Top level staff** and start typing the name of the person you want to be on the top level. Click on the person you want when you see them in the dropdown menu that opens. The name of the person you have selected will appear below the box.

### Set focal user

The focal user is the person the Org Chart will focus on when it is opened by clicking **Org Chart Viewer** in the top right of the People Directory, or when the **Reset** button is clicked while viewing the Org Chart. If the Org Chart is opened from a user's profile page, or from the icon beside a specific user's entry in the People Directory, the Org Chart will focus on that user.
