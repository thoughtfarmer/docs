# Profile strength

### Profile Strength indicator

The Profile Strength indicator is something that shows when a user edits their profile, and on a user's profile page for the page owner and admins. It only shows on the profile page if Profile Strength is less than 100%. Essentially, the more information a user adds to their profile, the stronger their profile strength. Below the Profile Strength indicator in edit mode, a user sees the last field they filled out that added to their Profile Strength, and suggestions on which fields to fill out next.
