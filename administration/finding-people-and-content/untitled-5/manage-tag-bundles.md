# Manage tag bundles

### Manage tag bundles <a id="section1"></a>

Tag bundles provide logical groupings for your tags. They allow users to quickly find and apply tags to content, which improves overall searchability. On this page you will learn how to add, localize and delete tag bundles.

#### Add a new tag bundle

Only Content Bundles can be added from the Tags page. Profile Field tag bundles \(aka Profile Fields\) can be viewed by clicking the name of a Profile Field under the Profile Field Tags tab, but must be created on the Profile details admin page as they are connected specifically to people's profiles. To learn more, see [Profile details](../untitled-7/).  
  
All tag bundles can be localized to show the user's preferred language. You can add a localized tag bundle name for every enabled language on your ThoughtFarmer intranet.

1. Go to the ThoughtFarmer **Administration panel**: **Content** section &gt; **Tags** page.
2. Click the **Content Bundles** tab.

1. If your intranet supports multiple languages, click **Show more languages**, and enter names for the bundle in the other languages.
2. Click **Save**.

#### Reorder bundles

Under the Content Bundles tab, the bundles are ordered alphabetically. Reordering the bundles affects how they appear in the Tags window when adding tags to a page, and in filters for search on the Search page or in the SuperNav. It does not affect their order on the Tags admin page.  
  
Only content tag bundles are shown in the bundles tab. Profile field bundles can be viewed under the Profile Field Tags tab but are created on the Profile Details page.

1. Go to the ThoughtFarmer **Administration panel**: **Content** section &gt; **Tags** page.
2. Click the **Content Bundles** tab.
3. Click **Reorder** on the right.
4. In the **Reorder** window, drag and drop the bundles to curate the order, or select a sort order from the **Sort by** menu.
5. Click **Save**.

#### Delete an existing tag bundle

When you delete an existing tag bundle, all tags in that bundle will move to "Unbundled tags". The tags will remain connected to the same content as before the deletion. To remove a tag from ThoughtFarmer completely, you need to [delete the tag manually](manage-tags.md).

1.Go to the ThoughtFarmer **Administration panel**: **Content** section &gt; **Tags** page.

2.Click the **Content Bundles** tab.

3.Select the checkbox beside the **Bundle name** for the bundle\(s\) you wish to delete. The name of the selected bundle\(s\) will show above the list.

### Manage tag to tag bundle associations <a id="section3"></a>

Tags can be created as part of a bundle, or added to a bundle later. If a tag is not associated with any tag bundle it is categorized under "Unbundled tags". Tags can also be associated with profile fields and the expertise locator. Only regular tag bundles are discussed here. Please see [Configure tags for the expertise locator](https://community.thoughtfarmer.com/content/106065/configure-tags-for-the-expertise-locator) for profile field tags.
