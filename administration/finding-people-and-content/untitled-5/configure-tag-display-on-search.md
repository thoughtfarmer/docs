# Configure tag display on search



### Configure how tags and facets are displayed on search

You can determine the number of facets and tags displayed when on search results pages, the Employee Directory, the Group Directory, and in the SuperNav Section Search.

If there are more tags or facets than the number you have configured here then users will be presented with an additional auto-complete box that will allow them to find the appropriate tag/facet to augment their search.
