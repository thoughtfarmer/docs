# ThoughtFarmer custom cards

### Add custom functionality to your Intranet using custom cards

ThoughtFarmer allows you to add custom cards using a powerful interface to extend the existing functionality of your intranet. It provides you with the ability to build features using HTML and JavaScipt as well as the React JS framework for creating JSX components. It also let's you style those features using cascading style sheets \(CSS\) or Sass \(Scss\).  
  
We've put together some in-depth documentation on what the Custom Card API looks like behind the scenes.
