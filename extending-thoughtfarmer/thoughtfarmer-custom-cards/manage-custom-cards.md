# Manage custom cards

To manage cards on your intranet first create a card through the Manage cards admin page \(to learn more see[create and edit custom cards](create-and-edit-custom-cards.md)\) and ensure it is working as expected and that it is set as **Active**. Any active card will now be available when [modifying the template](../../using-thoughtfarmer/add-pages-and-sections/modify-templates.md) for a specific page, or when [modifying page templates](../../administration/layout-and-appearance-1/content-templates/create-and-modify-template/)through the admin panel. Your card should be visible in the **Custom Cards** area of the template editor.
