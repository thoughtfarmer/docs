# Extending ThoughtFarmer

  
This section shows how developers can customize and extend the functionality of ThoughtFarmer.

With ThoughtFarmer custom cards, you can:

* Move information into and out of ThoughtFarmer, using our simple REST API.
* Enhance ThoughtFarmer with new functionality by embedding code into page templates.
* Provide single-sign on to services that provide a remote authentication API.

The REST API is accessible by any language that supports HTTP and JSON content. Embedding code in ThoughtFarmer is done with HTML, JavaScript and CSS\SCSS.
