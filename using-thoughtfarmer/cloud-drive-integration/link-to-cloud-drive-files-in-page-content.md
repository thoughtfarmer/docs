# Link to cloud drive files in page content



You can add links to cloud drive files and folders in the content of your page in the same way you would link to another intranet page or an external website. Use the insert link button in the Rich Text Editor to quickly connect your audience to the files they need.  
  
Links in page content are different than document library style links. To learn about linking files in cloud drive libraries, see [link or embed cloud drive files](link-and-embed-cloud-drive-files.md).  
  
To learn more about inserting links to intranet pages, external websites, email addresses and more, see [Insert links](../edit-page-contents/insert-links/).

4.In the pop-up window, click on the **tab** for the **cloud drive** that stores the file you want to link to. \(eg. Google Drive, OneDrive, SharePoint Online\). If you are not logged in to your account for the cloud drive, click **Login to \(cloud drive name\)** and follow the prompts to login.
