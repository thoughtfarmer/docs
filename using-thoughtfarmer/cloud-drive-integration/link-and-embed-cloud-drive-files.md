# Link and embed cloud drive files

### Cloud drive document libraries

When cloud drive integration is enabled, files and folders from cloud drives like Google Drive, OneDrive and SharePoint Online can be linked to and embedded on intranet pages.

Linked cloud drive files display similarly to files that have been uploaded to the intranet. Clicking on a linked file opens the cloud drive file in the cloud drive format in a new tab, allowing for editing for users with edit permissions on the file. Embedded files allow users to view the file contents right from the intranet page. Clicking on the title of an embedded file will also open the cloud drive file in a new tab. Embedded folders allow users to view the contents of the folder without having to go to the cloud drive.

3.To find the file or folder you want to link to:

1. In Google Drive, click on **My Drive** to open a dropdown menu where you can switch between viewing files in **My Drive**, **Shared with me**, **Recents** and **Team Drives**.
2. Click on a **folder name** to expand it and view the contents. The path to your current location in the navigation will show as a breadcrumb at the top of the files. Click on sections of the breadcrumb to go back up the navigation.
3. Alternatively, use the search bar to search for the file you want.
4. Select the checkbox beside the file\(s\) or folder\(s\) to select it.

4.Click **Link** to add the files or folders as document links in a document library. Click **Embed** to embed the files in the page \(file and folder contents can be viewed on the intranet page\).

### How to link or embed files in an existing cloud drive library

Once a cloud drive has already been added, more files and folders can be added simply by clicking **Add** beside the Cloud Drive name. The **Add files and folders** window will appear and the instructions above \(How to create a cloud drive document library\) can be followed from Step 3 on.

### Unshared files

If a file has been linked or embedded on a page, but has not been shared with a particular user, the user will see the message “File or folder unavailable. Learn more” where the file name would otherwise display. When the user clicks “Learn more”, they will be taken to the external cloud drive site to be provided with more information. The user may be able to request permission to have the file shared with them.

### Private files

If you link or embed a file or folder that has not been shared with anyone else, it will display with a lock icon beside the file name. If you hover over the lock icon, it says “Private – only you can access”. Other users will not be able to access that file, and will see the message “File or folder unavailable. Learn more” where the file name would otherwise display.
