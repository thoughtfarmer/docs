# Application Toolbar

### Application Toolbar features

The Application Toolbar is the top bar on every page of your intranet. From any page, it allows easy access to your homepage, Alerts, files you have open for editing, search, and profile page. Depending on the settings on your intranet, you can also access your Bookmarks, History \(recently viewed pages\), and Your Groups from the Application Toolbar. You can go directly to help information or to editing your profile page from the menu on the right of the Application Toolbar.

**On mobile devices**

The Home icon does not appear on the Application Toolbar on tablets or smartphones. To return to the Home page on a tablet, tap the **intranet logo**, or tap **Home** at the top of the left hand SuperNav. To return home on a smartphone, tap the **intranet logo**, or tap the **hamburger icon** \(three horizontal lines\) on the left of the Application Toolbar to expand the SuperNav, and then tap **Home**.

### Bookmarks and History

If both Bookmarks and History \(recently viewed pages\) are enabled on your intranet, they will appear in the same tab on the Application Toolbar. Click on Bookmarks or History in the Application Toolbar to open the menu, where you can toggle between the two lists. The Application Toolbar remembers which list you have used last and keeps that as the name of the menu on the Application Toolbar.  
  
Click on **Bookmarks** to see a list of pages you have bookmarked. Bookmark pages that you visit often \(click the star icon in the Page Sharing Buttons\) for easy access from any page on the intranet. Once you have bookmarked a page, you can edit the bookmark name or delete it from either this list or the Bookmarks Card. You can also add external websites or email addresses to your Bookmarks from the Bookmarks Card. \(See [how to use Bookmarks](bookmarks/) for more information on Bookmarks.\)

Click on **History** to see pages you have visited recently. Easily navigate back and forth between several pages using the **History** dropdown. Look here when you don't remember where in the navigation to find a certain page, but you know you've visited it recently.

**On mobile devices**

On smartphones, tap on the star icon to open the Bookmarks menu, and tap on the clock icon to open the History menu. You can toggle between the two tabs once the menu is open, and the icon that remains on the Application Toolbar indicates which tab you used last.

### Your Groups

If enabled, you will see a list of the groups you belong to in the Your Groups menu. This gives you easy access to team and project pages, and other groups relevant to your work.

**On mobile devices**

On smartphones, tap the person icon to open the Your Groups menu.

### Alerts

The Alerts menu has two tabs - Notifications and Mentions. You receive Notification alerts when changes are made to intranet pages that you follow. You receive Mention alerts when someone mentions you \(by typing @yourname\) in the body content of a page, a comment, or a Rich Text Card.

When you have new Alerts, the total number of new Notifications and Mentions will appear in the Alerts menu on the Application Toolbar. Click on the Alerts menu to view your new alerts, your notifications history, a list of all the pages that you follow, and your Shout-out history. \(To learn more about notifications, see [Following and Alerts](following-and-alerts/). To learn more about Shout-outs, see [Shout-outs](shout-outs.md).\)

**On mobile devices**

On smartphones, tap the flag icon to open the Alerts menu.

### Locked files

When you open files from your intranet so you can edit them, the **Locked files** menu appears in the Application Toolbar. Any files you open for editing are locked so that no one else can edit them at the same time. The intranet uses a behind-the-scenes application called the ThoughtFarmer Desktop Connector to communicate with your computer and to allow you to edit files from the intranet and save the changes back to the intranet. Click on **Locked files** in the Application Toolbar to see which files you have open for editing, and finish editing by clicking "Done editing" beside the file name.

**On mobile devices**

On smartphones, tap the lock icon to open the Locked files menu.

### Search

Click on Search to expand the search panel. For a basic search, enter a search term and click the search icon \(a magnifying glass\). You can also click on the menu at the left of the search bar to choose to search the people or groups directories, a particular section of the intranet, or an external search engine. Click on Advanced Search on the right to perform a search using filters. \(See [how to use search](../search/) for more information on search.\)

### Profile picture and name

Click on your profile picture icon or name to open a menu with several options. Click on your name or profile picture in the open menu to go to your profile page. **Edit profile** takes you into edit mode on your profile page. **Settings** takes you to a page where you can change your timezone, preferred language, archived content view, alternate emails and Notification settings. **Help** takes you to an intranet help site chosen by your intranet administrator. The **View archived content** toggle selects whether archived pages are visible to you or not. \(See [how to archive and delete pages](../edit-page-contents/archive-and-delete-pages.md) for more information on archiving.\) **Change password** takes you to a screen for changing your password. Depending on the method used to login and access your intranet, there may be a **Sign out** option in this menu. Administrators also have a toggle for entering/leaving Admin Mode and a link to the Administration panel from the profile menu.

On smartphones, only your profile photo appears in the Application Toolbar, not your name. Tap on your profile photo to open the menu.
