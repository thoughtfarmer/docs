# Comment on a files

### Leave a comment on a file

Adding a comment to a file is very similar to adding a comment on a gallery photo. Open the File Preview window - click on a file title to open the **File Editing Menu**, and click on **Preview** in the menu. \(Learn more about [File Preview](../../add-and-edit-files/attach-and-reorder-files.md).\) In the File Preview, just like in Image Preview, click in the **Leave a comment?** box, type your comment, and then click **Post**.

However, there are three different ways you can access the **Leave a comment?** box on a file:

1.Click the **file title**, which opens the **File Editing Menu**. Click **Preview** in the menu, which opens the **File Preview** window containing a **Leave a comment?** box.

1. Click the **file title**, which opens the **File Editing Menu**. Click **Go to file** in the menu, which takes you to the file page. Once on the file page, find the **Leave a comment?** box below the file.
2. Click the **Comment bubble** icon on the right of the file title, which opens the **File Preview** window containing a **Leave a comment?** box.

When multiple file versions have been uploaded to the intranet, it will say below each comment what version that comment was made on. That way you can keep track of when comments were made in the stream of version updates. \(Learn about [how to replace a file with a new version](../../add-and-edit-files/replace-files-with-new-versions.md).\)
