# Comments on gallery photos

### Comment on gallery photos

While browsing a photo gallery on your intranet, you're bound to see a photo that makes you want to comment on it. To add a comment to an image in a photo gallery, first click on it to see the larger Image Preview. In the Image Preview, click in the "Leave a comment?" box, type your comment, and then click "Post".

Once a comment is added to a photo, a little bubble displays in the top right of the photo on the main gallery page, showing how many comments have been made on that photo. Click on the photo to view the larger Image Preview with comments below. \(See complete instructions on [how to add a photo gallery](../../add-pages-and-sections/add-a-photo-gallery/).\)
