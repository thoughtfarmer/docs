# Following and Alerts



### Follow pages to be notified of changes

When you follow a page, it means you'll be notified when changes get made to the page. You're made aware of changes via in-app notifications on the Application Toolbar, desktop notifications and email notifications.  
  
You receive in-app notifications when edits and comments are made, when a page is added, or when other changes are made to a page you follow. In-app notifications show up in the **Notifications** tab of the **Alerts**menu on the Application Toolbar, to the right of the Bookmarks/History menu or Your Groups menu. When you have new notifications, a number appears on the Alerts menu, indicating how many new notifications you have. Desktop notifications appear on your screen when changes are made to pages while you are logged in to the intranet.  
  
You can keep up-to-date with a News, Blog or Forum page by following it, as you will receive a notification of every new post. You can also follow files and folders to learn about changes made to them. This allows you to keep up with changes to information you need to know about.

### Follow a page

1. Go to the page you want to follow.
2. Click the **Follow** icon \(a flag\) in the Page Sharing Buttons in the page header.

To choose whether or not to receive these emails, go to your **Profile Settings**. To do this, click on the **Alerts** menu in the Application Toolbar, then click the **gear icon** in the bottom right of the **Notifications** tab of the menu and find the **Summary emails** section.
