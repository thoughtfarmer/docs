# Desktop notifications

### Desktop notifications

When changes are made to pages you follow while you are logged in to your intranet, but not necessarily viewing your intranet, desktop notifications appear to alert you. Desktop notifications show in the bottom right or top right of your screen, depending on the browser that you use. Desktop notifications can be enabled and disabled by each user through their intranet browser. This type of notification is not supported by Intranet Explorer.  
  
At some point your browser will have asked you whether you want to receive notifications from your intranet site. If you want to change your desktop notification settings, follow these instructions:
