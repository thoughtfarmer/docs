# Shout-outs

### Recognize fellow employees with Shout-outs

Shout-outs are a great way of empowering employees to recognize one another for their outstanding contributions. In a few simple steps, users can send positive reinforcement to one colleague or several colleagues for a great presentation, a successful product launch, positive qualities, or anything else that deserves a Shout-outs. Shout-outs can be sent so that everyone in the organization sees them, or they can be directed to display on a particular group page and on the homepages of that groups' members.

###  When you type an @mention in a Shout-out, that results in the mentioned person or group members receiving a notification of the Shout-out. The profile photo of the mentioned person\(s\) will also show in the Shout-outs. Just like an update or message, Shout-outs can be liked, commented on, bookmarked, followed, and viewed on their own page.  Shout-outs can be sent from the homepage, group pages with Activity cards, your profile page, and Shout-outs Cards \(if enabled\).

### Send a Shout-out to Everyone or to a specific group

When you send a Shout-out, you can choose to either send it to Everyone, or to one of the groups that you belong to, depending on the settings your intranet administrator has chosen.

If you choose to send it **to Everyone**, the Shout-out will appear in the Highlights and Shout-outs tabs on all users' homepages, and in any Shout-outs Card that is configured to display Shout-outs sent to Everyone.  
  
If you choose to send a Shout-out **to a specific group** that you belong to, the Shout-out will appear on group members' homepages, in the activity Card on the group page you sent it to, and in any Shout-out Cards configured to display Shout-outs sent to that group.

### Send a Shout-out on a group page

On a group page, you can send a Shout-out about whoever you like, but the Shout-out can only be sent to the group. The Shout-out will show on group members' homepages, in the Group page activity, and in any Shout-out card that is set up to display Shout-outs that are sent to that group.
