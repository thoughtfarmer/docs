### News on group pages feeds into homepage

Sharing news is an important aspect of using your ThoughtFarmer intranet. Your intranet homepage and group pages have special features for displaying and posting news. Included in the Homepage News are both news stories targeted at all employees, and personalized news stories just for you. The personalized stories are fed by group pages of which you are a member.  
  
For group News to show on the homepage, News Sources need to be added to News Cards on the group page. \(For more information, see [How to set up News on group pages](../add-pages-and-sections/add-a-group-page/set-up-news-or-group-pages.md).\)  
Blogs, Forums, and News sections are all similar and can be considered as "news" sections in the context of this page. News Cards may be found on different types of pages where displaying content from other sources is useful to the page's purpose.
