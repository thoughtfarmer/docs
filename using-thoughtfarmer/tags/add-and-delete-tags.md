# Add & delete tags



### How to add & delete tags on pages

Use these instructions to add tags to pages on the intranet and to delete tags. On any page for which you have edit permission you can add tags. Think of tags as search keywords that help make your page easier for you and others to find. Adding tags is easy, even fun and you can just as easily delete tags.  
  
Once you add a new tag to a page, the tag is added to the system and other employees will be able to see and use that tag on other pages. Your ThoughtFarmer intranet tagging feature includes "search type ahead" technology that brings up any matching tags as you type \(just like Google search results\). If a tag already exists you can easily find it and pick it from the list without recreating it. You can also choose from a list of Recommended Tags that your intranet has determined would be helpful to have on that page.

### How to add tags

**You can add tags either while viewing a page or in edit mode:**

* When viewing a page: Click the down arrow at the bottom right of the page header to expand the Page Controls. Click **Add tags** or the **Edit icon** \(a pencil\) in the Page Controls. This brings up the **Tags** pop-up window.

2.Click once on a tag from the matching list to select it; or type your new tag and click on **create new tag** in the list. Alternatively, select from the **Recommended tags** displayed by clicking on the tag you want. The tag will appear on the list in the pop-up window.

3.Continue adding tags or click the **Save** button \(or the **Done** button if you are in edit mode\) at the bottom of the pop-up window. The tags will appear in a list under the **Tags** section.

When adding or editing tags, you can view all existing tags by clicking **Show all tags** below the Recommended tags. This expands to show all existing tags sorted into tag bundles and unbundled tags. You can sort the tags by alphabetical order or frequency of usage by clicking on one of the sort options displayed.

### How to delete tags

You can delete any tag from a page on which you have edit permission. When you delete a tag it is removed from the page, but still exists within the system so you and others can use it later on.

### Hot intranet tip!

**Add parenthetical full term to acronym tags**

Are you adding an acronym as a tag? Don't just type the acronym, type the full term. This way when you and others add that tag to a page, you'll be able to find the page through searches for either the acronym or the full term.  
  
**Example**: For the acronym "_TLA_" create the tag "_TLA \(three letter acronyms\)_"
