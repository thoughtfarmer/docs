### How to use tags to help people find stuff

Use these instructions to add and delete tags on pages, files and gallery photos. Tags are basically search keywords and the easiest way to come up with good tags is to ask yourself "_What words would I use to search for this page or file six months from now?_" Your ThoughtFarmer intranet allows you to add tags to any page or file on which you have edit permission.  
  
The intranet search engine includes tags as part of the searchable text of a page. Add a tag and you're adding an additional word that people could search for to get to the page, file or photo.  
  
When you search the intranet, the People Directory, or the Groups Directory, you'll see a list of popular tags that have been added to pages that show up in your search results. You can then use the tags to narrow down search results.
