### How to add tags to photos on a photo gallery page

Adding tags to gallery photos adds a searchable term that can help people find photos. If you add the term "fundraiser" to photos of a company charity event, when someone searches for "fundraiser" on the internet, those photos will be returned as part of the search results.   
  
To add tags to gallery photos:

1.Go to the photo gallery page.
