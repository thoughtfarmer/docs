# Add tags to files



### How to add tags to a file

You can add tags to files that you have edit permission on to help other people find the files they need. Tags added to files are like extra search keywords that will help people find files they are searching for.  
 

1.Click the **down arrow** on the far right of the file name to expand the **File Controls**.
