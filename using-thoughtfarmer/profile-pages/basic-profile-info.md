To learn more about the **Configure profile cards** option in the top right of Edit Profile, see [Configure profile Cards](configure-profile-cards.md).

### Some fields cannot be edited

Some of the information fields on your profile are connected to the central user directory that your IT Department maintains \(called "Active Directory"\). Most of these fields cannot be edited on your profile page. Which fields are editable depends on how your ThoughtFarmer intranet is setup.  
  
In the list below a star \(\*\) next to a profile field indicates that it is usually not editable.

### Profile Strength

If enabled by your intranet administator, a Profile Strength indicator will show on your profile page and when editing your profile. Profile Strength relates to how many profile fields you have filled out, and is displayed as a percentage. On your profile page, the Profile Strength indicator displays only to you and to intranet admins, and it only shows if your Profile Strength is less than 100%. Click on the words **Profile Strength** on your profile page to go into edit mode on your profile.

Your administrator determines which profile fields contribute to your Profile Strength rating. Below the Profile Strength indicator in edit profile you'll see the last field that you completed, and suggestions for which fields you could fill in to improve your Profile Strength. As you fill in fields, the Profile Strength indicator updates in real-time without having to save your profile information.

### Name, contact info and other default fields

The list below includes explanations for all the default profile fields on your intranet. In edit profile, click on the different profile info headings to expand that section and add information.

#### Profile photo and cover photo

* **Cover photo**: If enabled on your intranet, you can add a photo that will fill the page header on your profile page.
* **Photo**: Your profile photo, which will show as a thumbnail on your comments and activities on the intranet. You may be able to add your own profile photo, or it may be a non-editable field that contains your official work photo.
