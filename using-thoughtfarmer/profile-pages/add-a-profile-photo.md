# Add a profile photo

### Profile photos make the intranet more human

Use the instructions in this section to upload or replace a photo, select a great profile photo in the right file format, and avoid common profile photo mistakes. You'll be amazed at how much more alive and personal the intranet feels when comments and recent activity are accompanied by thumbnails of profile photos. A photo on your profile page makes you so much more real to colleagues who work in different offices and don't get to see you in person. It will also make it easier for visiting colleagues to recognize you.

### Photo details

* **Close enough to recognize face**: Use a photo that shows your face clearly. You want someone who has never met you before to see you for the first time and say "I recognize you from your profile photo!"
* **Choose the photo crop**: The default crop is centered in the photo vertically and horizontally, but you can zoom in to focus on your face, and click and drag to change the part of the photo that displays.
* **Recommended image size for ThoughtFarmer**: The recommended minimum size for profile photos on your ThoughtFarmer intranet is 300x300 pixels. This allows for some cropping and positioning while still maintaining a clear photo.
* **Considerations for Active Directory**: Your intranet can be set up to sync its profile photos with your organization's Active Directory \(AD\). If this is the case, you may want to pick a profile photo that will work with AD's photo restrictions. Photos in AD must be 96x96 pixels or smaller, and 100kb or smaller. You can upload a larger photo, but it's size will be reduced before syncing with AD, and this may affect the quality of the photo if AD uses it for other applications. Please note that the photo sync does not support animated GIFs for profile photos.
* **Correct orientation**: Occasionally, a photo may have data connected to it that causes it to upload in the wrong orientation. If this happens, just click the **Rotate left** or **Rotate right** options in the **Profile photo** pop-up window that appears after uploading your photo.

### File formats for profile photos

Photo files come in many different formats, each with it's own special file extension. Supported file types are GIF, JPG and PNG.
