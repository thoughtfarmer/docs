# Configure profile cards

### Cards on your profile page

Like other pages on the intranet, your profile page is made up of Cards. Your intranet administrator chooses which Cards are available to use on the profile page template. Some Cards have options you can select, and others Cards require setup before they will display on your profile page. To learn more about Cards, see Overview of Cards and [How to set up Cards.](../add-pages-and-sections/set-up-cards/)  
  
Common Cards that you might find on a profile page are News, Location, Bookmark Manager, Document library and Activity.  
  
To configure the Cards on your profile page, **edit your profile** and click **Configure profile cards** in the top right.
