# Add a profile cover photo

### Cover photos add personality to your profile

If it's enabled on your intranet, you can personalize your profile even more by adding a cover photo that will show as the page header on your profile page! Your profile will by default have the same page header photo/gradient that is found on its parent page - the People Directory. However, once you change your cover photo, it will not be affected by changes to the People Directory page header photo. If you don't want to add a cover photo, you can still pick which gradient color you want your profile page header to be.

### Image size and file type

The recommended image size for a profile cover photo is 1200 x 700 pixels. When the Page Controls on your profile page are expanded by clicking the down arrow on the right of the page header, the cover photo will expand to fill the whole Page Controls area. Recommended file types are GIF, JPG and PNG.

### How to add a cover photo to your profile
