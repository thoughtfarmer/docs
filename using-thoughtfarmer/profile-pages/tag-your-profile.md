### Useful types of tags on your profile

_**When are tags on your profile useful?**_ When someone searches the People Directory because they need an answer you have!  
  
Every day we try to find information we need to do our jobs. Often that information lives in the brains of colleagues, but we don't always know who to contact. Tags on your profile can make it easier for people to find you for questions to which you might know the answer. But you've got to add the right types of tags.
