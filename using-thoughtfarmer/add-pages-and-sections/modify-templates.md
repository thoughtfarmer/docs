# Modify templates



### Modify templates with Cards

An organization using ThoughtFarmer can choose to give permission to modify the templates for individual pages to:

1. Administrators only,
2. Everyone with View & Edit permission on a page, or
3. Members of a specific security profile when they have View & Edit permission on a page.

So depending on your organization, you may or may not have the ability to modify page templates using the instructions below. If you do not have permission to modify a page template, but would like to customize something, talk with your intranet administrator.  
  
If you're an administrator, to learn more see [Page type template permissions](../basic-features/cards.md).  
  
For a basic introduction to Cards, see [Overview of Cards](https://community.thoughtfarmer.com/content/105833).

### How to start modifying a template

2.Click **Set up cards** under the **Content type & template** heading on the right. The **Update Cards** pop-up window will open.

To learn more, see [How to set up Cards on a page](set-up-cards/).

### How to delete a Card

Certain Cards cannot be deleted from templates, such as the Left Navigation Card and the Page Header Card. These Cards are indicated with a lock icon in the Update Cards window. In some instances, a Card does not have to be deleted from the Update Cards window for it not to show on the page. For instance, if a page has a News Card, but the Card contains no News Sources \(either because it was never set up, or because all its News Sources have been removed\), then the News Card will not show up on the page. To delete a Card:

1.Click the **Edit button** \(pencil icon\) in the page header to go into edit mode on the page.

2.Click **Set up cards** under the **Content type & template** heading on the right. The Update Cards pop-up window will open.

3.At the top left beside the selected template name, click **Modify template.** You will now see trashcan icons on the right of some Cards, indicating that you can delete those Cards.

4.Locate the Card you want to delete, and click the **trashcan icon** on the right of the Card.
