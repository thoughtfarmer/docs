# Add a gallery-style post

### Add a gallery-style News or Blog post

You may want to have a Blog or News post that showcases images the same way that a Gallery page type does. Your intranet administrator may have created a Post template that includes a Photo gallery details card. If that is the case, select the appropriate template when creating the post, and you are good to go. If not, follow the steps below to create a gallery-style post. You need to have permission to modify individual templates to follow these instructions.

3.Enter a title for your post in the **Enter a title** box. Enter content for your post in the Rich Text Editor if desired.

5.Click **Modify template** in the **Update Cards pop-up window**.

6.Click the **plus sign** in the main column \(where you want to add the gallery\).

8.Click **Done** in the **Card setup pop-up window**.

9.**Publish** the page \(or select the **Private** checkbox and then **Save** the page if you want to add photos before publishing it\).

10.Click **Add images** to add images to the gallery post. \(To learn more about adding and modifying images in a gallery, see [Add a photo gallery](./).\) Once your images have uploaded, you'll see your Blog or News post populated with gallery-style photos.

For a gallery-style post to appear with an image in List or Grid View News, you need to add a Thumbnail image to the post. To learn more, see [How to add a Thumbnail Image](../../edit-page-contents/add-thumbnail-images/).
