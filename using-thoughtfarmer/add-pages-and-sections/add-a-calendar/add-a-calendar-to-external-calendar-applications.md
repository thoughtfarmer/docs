# Add a calendar to external calendar applications



### Add intranet calendar to Windows Outlook, Apple Calendar or Google calendars

With just a few clicks you can add a copy of an intranet calendar to your calendars in MS Outlook, Apple Calendar or Google calendars. The calendar will be "read only" which means it can be viewed in Outlook, but you won't be able to edit it in Outlook. The calendar will update automatically when new events are added on the intranet so you can always keep up-to-date. If you have Outlook 2010/2013, follow the instructions in the section below this one.
