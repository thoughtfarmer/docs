# Add a Calendar

### How to add Calendar pages

Use these instructions to add calendars to your intranet. By choosing the Calendar page type you transform the way subpages appear: Instead of showing up listed in the left-hand SuperNav, subpages appear as events on specific dates \(or across multiple days\) on your calendar.  
  
You and your colleagues can collaborate on adding events to the calendar. For any event you can list oodles of info on the event page itself, post comments to start a discussion, or attach files.

See also [how to add a calendar event](add-calendar-event.md) for information on adding events to calendars.  
 

**View intranet calendars in Windows Outlook, Apple Calendar or Google calendars**

You can even add a read-only version of an intranet calendar to Windows Outlook. Do this so you can see everything that is added to the calendar from the convenience of your email account. See [how to add a calendar to MS Outlook](add-a-calendar-to-external-calendar-applications.md) for more information.

**Create a shared calendar**

You can create a calendar that combines events from several other existing calendars on the intranet. See [how to add a shared calendar](add-shared-calendar.md) for more information.

### Add a new calendar page

1. Navigate to where you want to create the new page and click the **Add button** \(plus icon\) on the right of the page header.
2. Give the page a clear title. It's a good bet to include **Calendar** in the page title.
   1. **Example**: _Calendar of Vancouver Office Potlucks & Parties_.
3. Click on the **Content type** dropdown on the right and select the **Calendar** content type. \(The Template Calendar will automatically be selected.\)
4. Available event types on your calendar will appear under the **Calendar Event Types** heading on the left. Click on **Edit event types** if you want to change the event types that will be available to users adding events to your calendar. In the **Edit event types** pop-up window, select the checkboxes for the events that you want to be available to add to your calendar. Click the **Primary** radio button on the right of the event that you want to be the default selected event type for the calendar. Click **Done** when you are done editing event types.
5. \(optional\) Select the **Lock this page** checkbox if desired. \(To learn more see **Lock this page feature** below.\)

6.Click on **Security permissions** on the right under **Security** and make sure all the right people have edit permission on the page. \(See complete instructions on [how to change permissions to view & edit](../../security-settings-and-permissions/permission-to-view-and-edit.md).\) Click **Done** when you are finished.

1. Click **Publish** and your Calendar page will appear, ready for events to be added.

The main part of your new page will look like a calendar. At the top left of the calendar you will see little arrows that let you jump from month to month \(or week, or day\), and a **Today** button that lets you jump to today's date. At the top right of the calendar are buttons that allow you to switch to viewing the calendar by month, week or day.

### Lock this page feature

Once the page display option is set to Calendar, a new option appears in edit mode - the checkbox **Lock this page**. If you check this box, people who have edit permission can still add new events, but they are not able to make edits to the main Calendar page itself - it is "locked". Only the page owner can edit the calendar page when it is locked.

### View Calendar content on another page

If you want calendar events to automatically feed into another page \(eg. a group page\), add the Calendar as a Source on a News Card on the page you want the events to appear on. To learn more, see [How to add a News Card](../../add-content-with-news-cards/add-new-cards.md).
