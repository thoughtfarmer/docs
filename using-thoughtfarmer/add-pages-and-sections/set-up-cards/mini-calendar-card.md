# Mini Calendar Card

### Set up a Mini Calendar Card for quick reference to upcoming events

A Mini Calendar Card gives people an easy way of referencing past, present and future events, without having to visit the calendar page itself. In order to use a Mini Calendar Card, the calendar you want to display in the Card must already exist somewhere on the intranet.
