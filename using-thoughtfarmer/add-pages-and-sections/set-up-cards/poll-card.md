# Poll Card

### Set up a Poll Card to get instant feedback from intranet users

A Poll Card is a way to engage users in your page and let them express their opinions and give you useful feedback. When you add a Poll Card, you can choose to have it display the most current poll created on the intranet, or you can choose to display any poll existing on the intranet.

Once a user votes on a poll, the Poll Card displays the poll results.

4.By default, the radio button **Specify the poll** is selected. You can either choose a specific poll to display, or select the radio button **Latest poll** to always have the most recently created poll on the intranet displayed. The Poll Card will not display on the page until either a specific poll is selected, or the **Latest poll** radio button is selected. If you want a specific poll to appear, select the radio button **Specify the poll**, and follow steps 5 and 6.
