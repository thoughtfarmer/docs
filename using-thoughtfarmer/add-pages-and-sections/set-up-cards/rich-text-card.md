# Rich Text Card

### Set up a Rich Text Card to include a variety of content on the page

Pretty much anything that you can put in the Rich Text Editor when you are editing a page can also be displayed in a Rich Text Card anywhere on your page. A Rich Text Card can be used for text, images, links and more.

If you don't see a Rich Text Card in the Update cards window, talk to your intranet administrator about making the Rich Text Card available for you to use.  
The size and layout of your Rich Text Card will depend on the layout of your page and the size of the device it is viewed on.
