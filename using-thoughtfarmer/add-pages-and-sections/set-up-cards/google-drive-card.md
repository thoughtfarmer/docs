### Set up a Google Drive Card to access files

ThoughtFarmer 9 allows for greater integration with cloud drives such as Google Drive. See cloud drive integrations to learn about the additional features.  
  
A Google Drive Card allows you to embed files on your Google Drive into intranet pages. Users can view the file on the page, and if the file owner has granted permission, they can click on the file title to open it in Google Drive and make changes to it.  
  
The Google Drive Card is a Standard Card that comes with ThoughtFarmer, however it must be enabled by an administrator. See Google Drive integration for administrator instructions on how to enable Google Drive integration.

6.Click **Update** at the bottom of the list of files.

7.Click **Done** at the bottom of the **Update Cards** window.

Users must have the file shared with them in Google Drive in order to view it in a ThoughtFarmer Google Drive Card. Users who have been given permission to edit the file in Google Drive can click on the file title in the Google Drive Card to open the file for editing in a new tab.  
  
The size and scope of your Google Drive Card will depend on the layout of your page and the size of the device it is viewed on.
