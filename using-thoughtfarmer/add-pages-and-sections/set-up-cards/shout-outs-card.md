# Shout-outs Card

### Set up a Shout-outs Card to promote employee recognition

Shouts-outs are a great way of empowering employees to recognize one another for their outstanding contributions. In a few simple steps, users can send positive reinforcement to one colleague or several colleagues for a great presentation, a successful product launch, positive qualities, or anything else that deserves a Shout-out.
