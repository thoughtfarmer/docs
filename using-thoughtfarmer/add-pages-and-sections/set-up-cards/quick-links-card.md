# Quick Links Card

### Set up a Quick links Card for easy navigation to internal or external pages and applications

Add useful links for your team to your group page, or add links to material that is closely related to a page's content. You can link to intranet pages, external webpages \(perhaps often used applications\) and email addresses.
