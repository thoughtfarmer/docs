# Photo Collection Card

### Set up a Photo collection Card to share experiences and add visual interest

A Photo collection Card adds visual interest to your page by engaging viewers with a gallery of thumbnail images. Users can click on the thumbnails to view larger versions of the photos or click on the Photo collection title to go to the Photo Gallery page.

2. **Popular**: sorts photos by popularity, determined by comments, likes, views and recent activity
3. **Date uploaded \(newest\)**: sorts photos from newest to oldest

7.Click **Update** on the right of the Photo collection setup window.

8.Click **Done** at the bottom of the Update cards window.

 If you don't see a Photo collection Card in the Update cards window, talk to your intranet administrator about making the Photo collection Card available for you to use.  
The size and layout of your Photo collection Card will depend on the layout of your page and the size of the device it is viewed on.
