# Content types



### Learn about content types

There are eight content types to choose from when you create or edit a page. The content type you select depends on the purpose of your page. To select a content type in edit mode, click on the **Content type** dropdown on the right and click on a content type.

* **Page**: Your multi-purpose knowledge-sharing page. Store, share, or collaborate on information. 
* **Section**: Landing page or directory where users can jump off into other areas of related content. It's not about what's _on_ the page, but where you can _get to_ from the page.
* **Group**: Connect people with something in common via shared news streams and activity. Groups are great for projects, departments, offices, teams, and shared interests.
* **News/Blog**: Keep people up-to-date on news about an office or department, or chronicle your journey through a project.
* **Forum**: Ideal for discussing topics, collaborating on ideas, and getting answers to questions. Forum posts can be viewed by the most recently active posts, or the most popular posts.
* **Calendar**: Schedule meetings, training, vacations, and other events on calendars that can be viewed by month, week, or day. Calendar event pages contain more details about individual events.
* **Photo Gallery**: Photo galleries are designed to showcase images. Click on images for a larger slideshow view.

When you add a page, there is also the option to choose **Link** from the content type dropdown. When you select **Link**, rather than creating a page, you are creating a link in the navigation of the parent and sibling pages.

* **Link**: Create links in the page navigation for easy access to other intranet pages, external web sites, or even email addresses.

When you add a page to a calendar, you automatically create an **Event** page type. When you add a page to a news or blog page, you automatically create a **Post**. When you add a page to a forum, you automatically create a **Topic**, **Question**, or **Idea**, depending on the forum type.

### How to select a content type

1. In Edit mode, click on the **Content type** box, and select the content type you want from the dropdown menu.
2. Depending on the content type you chose and the setup on your intranet, you will need to select a template next. See [Learn about templates](templates.md) for more information.
