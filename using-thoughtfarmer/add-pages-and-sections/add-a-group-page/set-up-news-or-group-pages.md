# Set up News or group pages



### How to set up News cards on group pages that feed into personalized homepages

Use these instructions to add News that comes from external websites or internal News, Blog, Forum or Calendar sections to a group page, and create new posts directly from a group page. News posted to the group page shows up in the personalized homepage News sections of all group members. Group members can even add posts directly from the homepage.

### First, create or find relevant News or Blog sections

Before you can add News on a group page you need an existing News, Blog, Forum or Calendar page as a Source.
