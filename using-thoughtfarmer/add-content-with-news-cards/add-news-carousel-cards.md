# Add News Carousel Cards

### News Carousels add visual interest <a id="section2"></a>

News Carousels draw a lot of attention by rotating through a series of News posts with images or videos. You can select the number of posts that will appear in a carousel rotation. Viewers can hover over the carousel to pause the rotation, and can navigate from post to post using the arrows that appear on hover, or the circles below the carousel that represent each post. If a news post contains a video, users can view the video right from the carousel.

### Image size for Carousel posts

Because of the highly visual nature of News Carousels, it is important that News Carousel posts have appropriate Thumbnail images and cropping. To learn more, see [How to add a Thumbnail image](../edit-page-contents/add-thumbnail-images/). For recommended image sizes for News Carousel posts, see [News display options](new-display-options.md) or Image size guidelines.
