# Add New Cards



### How to add content to a page with a News Card

Use these instructions to add or remove content in News Cards on an intranet page. By adding Sources to a News Card, updated content is constantly added from the Sources. This could be content from any News, Blog, Forum, or Calendar page on the intranet, or from external websites. It's like a magazine subscription - once you sign up, you automatically receive the newest magazine when it is published.  
  
In the News Card setup you can customize the way the posts display, including whether or not posts show summaries and how many posts to show from each Source.

### Edit page and click "Set up cards"

1.Navigate to the page that you want to add a News Card to and click the **Edit button** \(pencil icon\) in the page header to go into edit mode.

2.Click **Set up cards** under the **Content type & template** heading on the right. The **Card setup** pop-up window will open.

### How to use News Cards to create group News on users' homepages

Adding content to a group page with a News Card is just like adding a News Card to any page on the intranet, with one added benefit. When you add a News Card to any column on a group page, the News items from that Card also display on all of the group members' homepages. Intranet users are automatically updated to news and events from their groups, just by signing in to the intranet and viewing their homepage - no need to visit all their individual group pages. Learn more about [How to set up News on group pages](../add-pages-and-sections/add-a-group-page/set-up-news-or-group-pages.md).
