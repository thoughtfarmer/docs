### News layouts

Three layouts are available for the News Card. The News Carousel Card provides a fourth possible layout.

### News: Grid View

In Grid View, News items display in a Grid of cards, with each News post on its own card. The News post image displays in the top portion of the card with the News post title in it. The lower portion of the card contains the News item excerpt or summary, posted date and author. Buttons to Like and Comment are at the bottom of the post.

### News: List View

In List View, News items display in a vertical list. On larger screens, images display on the left of News post titles and their excerpts/summaries. On smaller screens, images display above News post titles and excerpts/summaries. News post date and author show below the post, along with options to Like and Comment on the post.

### News: List View—No Images

This layout is just like News: List View with News items displaying in a vertical list, except that it is text only—no images display.

### News Carousel

The News Carousel captures attention with its highly visual nature. It is great for featuring News items with interesting images or videos. The Carousel rotates through a selected number of news items before pausing on the first item. Users can navigate through the items using the arrows or progress dots at the bottom of the Carousel. The width of the carousel depends on the layout of the page, the width of the column it is placed in, and the width of the screen it is viewed on.

### Recommended image sizes and file types

The image that you want to display with the news post must be selected as the Thumbnail image on the post page.
