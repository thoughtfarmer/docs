# Create multilingual page



### How to create a page with multiple language versions

Use these instructions to create a page with versions in several different languages. When users visit a page, they will automatically see the page in their default site language if a version exists in that language. Users will also have pages in their preferred language prioritized in search results. You don't have to create a bunch of separate pages - one for each language - and people can easily switch between language versions of a page.  
  
You can either create multilingual versions of a page manually using human translation or by using the intranet's built-in auto-translation feature. But remember, auto-translated pages rely on a machine which can't offer nearly the accuracy of human translation.

### Edit page to create multiple language versions

1.Navigate to the page you want multiple language versions of and click the **Edit button** \(pencil icon\) to go into edit mode.

2.In the top right, click on the **dropdown menu** to the left of **Translate** and select the ****icon for the language version you want to create. \(See the list of language icons below.\)

b.You can switch between language versions while you edit by clicking on the dropdown menu and clicking any of the language icons.

3.Add the page title and content in the language you have selected.

4.Click **Save** at the top of the page.

### Create multilingual versions using auto-translate

In order to complete this step you need to already have created the page with a title and content in at least one language.

1. Navigate to the page you want multiple language versions of and click the **Edit button** \(pencil icon\) to go into edit mode.
2. To the right of the language icon menu click **Translate** and select your initial and target languages from the list. The page will switch to that language version and the title and content will automatically fill in using that language.

3.Continue editing or click **Save** at the top of the page.

### Hot intranet tip!

**Avoid mismatched text & language versions**

If the Spanish version of a page has English text and content then the fancy auto-translation and language auto-display features won't work!  
  
Double-check your work when you are creating multilingual pages and make sure the language of the title and content you're writing matches the language version of the page you are editing.  
  
For **example**, if you are editing the Spanish version of the page \(ES\) make sure not to write in English text. And if you are editing the English version \(EN\) be sure not to write in Spanish text.
