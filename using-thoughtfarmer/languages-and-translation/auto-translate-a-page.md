# Auto-translate a page

### How to get an instant auto-translation of a page

Use these instructions to get instant auto-translations of pages on your ThoughtFarmer intranet. With just one click you can view machine-translated versions of any page. "Machine translation" means a computer has translated from one language to another, as opposed to human translation by someone fluent in both languages.  
  
An auto-translation can give you a sense of what a page is about, but don't rely on it for detailed and accurate translations. Humans still have a hand up on machines in this arena!  
  
If a page has a Translate Card on it, it can be translated into the preferred language you have set on your profile, or into another language of your choice.

### Automatic or Manual auto-translation

Your intranet administrator will have chosen whether the Translate Card translates automatically, or only when prompted to.  
  
If the Translate Card is set to **Automatic** on the intranet, when you visit a page that is not in your preferred language and has the Translate Card on it, it will automatically be translated into your preferred language.  
  
**The Translate Card is pretty low-key - it's just an icon with the word "Translate"**

If the Translate Card is set to **Manual** on the intranet, when you visit a page that is not in your preferred language you will need to click "Translate" in the Translate Card to get an auto-translation into your preferred language.  
  
Once the page is translated, you can hover over sentences to see the original language text appear in a pop-up box.

### Translate to a language that is not your preferred language

You can also translate to a language other than your preferred language, whether auto-translate is set to Manual or Automatic.  
  
When translation occurs, \(whether automatically, or because you clicked "Translate"\) a small Bing Translator window will appear somewhere on the page. The Bing Translator window will show the language that the page has been translated into \(if no language is displayed, click on the Bing Translator bar to show the current language.\) Click on the current language to open the language menu, then click on the language that you want the page to translate into. After a moment, you will see the auto-translated text in the language you have chosen. Click the X on the Bing Translator window to return to the original language page.

### Add a Translate Card to a page

If you want users to be able to use auto-translation on a page you're creating, you need to have the Translate Card on the page. If the Translate Card is not already a part of the page template you are using, you will need to modify the template to add it. Modifying templates may require special permission. If you don't see the option to modify the template, talk to your intranet administrator for help.  
  
To add a Translate Card:

1.Go into edit mode on the page.

2.Click **Set up cards** on the right.
