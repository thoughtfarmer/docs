### How to view & create multilingual versions of pages

Use these instructions to set your site language and view and translate multilingual pages. Your ThoughtFarmer intranet offers pretty sweet multilingual features that make viewing and creating pages in multiple languages a breeze.  
  
Once you set your default site language you'll see all the standard intranet terms \(such as **Search**, **Add page**, **Notifications**, etc.\) in your preferred language. Search results will be prioritized based on matches found in your preferred language. When you visit a page with multiple language versions you'll automatically see the one in your preferred language, if that version exists. And you can easily switch between different language page versions.

### How do I?

* [Set my default site language](set-default-language.md)
* [View multilingual versions of a page](view-language-versions.md)
* [Create multiple language versions of a page](create-multilingual-page.md)
