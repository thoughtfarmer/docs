# Share page to a group

### Share a page with all the members of a group

Did you just create or discover an intranet page that will be useful to your whole project team or office location members? You can share a page to a group that you belong to, and bring it to all group members' attention in one action.

When you share a page, it shows in the Activity on the group page, and also in the homepage Activity of group members. The Share Page activity item shows the name and photo of the person who shared the page and the group they shared it with. The page title displays along with a page excerpt or summary if one exists, and any message you have added to the page share.  
  
Group members will receive in-app notifications of the page share, and depending on their profile settings, they may also receive an email about it.  
  
You can also choose to share a page with Everyone \(all users on your intranet\) from the Share to group window, just keep in mind how many people you'll be sending it to!
