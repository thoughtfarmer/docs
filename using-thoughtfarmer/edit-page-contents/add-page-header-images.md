# Add page header images

### Page header images add personality to the intranet

You can add visual interest and either uniqueness or continuity by adding a page header image. The page header is the area below the Main Navigation Bar that contains the page title, Add, Edit and Page Sharing Buttons. If you click the down arrow on the right of the page header, it expands to reveal the Page Controls area. A unique page header image can make a page stand out from others on the intranet. However, choosing to have the same page header throughout a section of the intranet can lend continuity to a department's pages, or to information all related to the same topic. Page header images can be used to good effect for different purposes.  
  
If you don't want to add a photo in your page header, you can pick a gradient color to show in the page header.

### Page header image inheritance

Pages by default will have the same page header image/gradient that is found on their parent page. Once you change the page header image on a page, it is no longer affected by changes to the parent page's page header image.

### Image size and file type

The recommended image size for a page header image is 1200 x 700 pixels. When the Page Controls on a page are expanded by clicking the down arrow on the right of the page header, the page header image will expand to fill the whole Page Controls area. Recommended file types are GIF, JPG and PNG.

### How to add a page header image to a page

1**.**In edit mode, click on the **edit icon** \(a pencil\) in the top right of the page header image \(which shows behind the title box\). The **Choose Image** pop-up window will appear.

### Use page header image for Thumbnail

When you add a new page header image, a new option becomes available in the Thumbnail image section - to use the page header image for the Thumbnail image. If the page header image is the only image available on the page, it will automatically be selected as the thumbnail image.

If there are multiple images available on the page, add the page header image to the page, then under the Thumbnail heading on the right, select the checkbox **Use page header image**. The page header image will show in the Thumbnail section, and if you change the page header image in the future, the Thumbnail image will automatically change.
