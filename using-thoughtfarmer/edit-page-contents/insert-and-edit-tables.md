# Insert and edit tables



### How to insert & edit basic tables on an intranet page

Use these instructions to add simple tables to intranet pages. You can easily add and remove rows and columns as well as merge and split cells. With tables you can create more structured formatting for the text on your page.  
  
But if you're looking for advanced table features such as functions \(SUM, etc.\) or automatic alphabetical sorting, your best bet is to use an Excel spreadsheet \(or something similar\). Tables on your intranet page can be helpful, but aren't meant to replace full-featured spreadsheets.

### Insert table & select size using "Insert Table" button

You can quickly insert a table and select the number of rows and columns \(up to eight\) with the **Insert Table** button.

1.Click the **Edit button** \(pencil icon\) in the page header to go into edit mode.

2.Set the cursor where you want to insert the table, click the **Insert Table** button ![6.5User7958InsertTable.png](https://community.thoughtfarmer.com/imagethumb/2514070000/15907/1000x1000/False/6.5User7958InsertTable.png) and then in the grid that pops up select the number of columns and rows to start with. Your simple table will appear on the page. \(The **Insert Table** button looks like a tiny table or grid, with a green plus sign on it.\)

3.Now you can set the cursor in any cell and start typing. The table initially fills the whole width of the screen, and adjusts as you enter content in the table.

4.Continue editing or click **Save** at the top of the page.

### Adjust column width

When you first insert a table, the cells are sized so that the table fills the entire width of the rich text editor window. When you start typing in the table, the column widths will adjust based on the amount of text entered into each cell. You can adjust the column width manually by hovering over the right edge of a cell in the column you want to adjust. When your cursor turns into a double arrow \(adjust width symbol\), click and drag the cell edge to adjust the width.

2In the menu that appears select the option you need:

**i.Under "Column"**: You can insert a column to the right \(**Insert Column After**\) or left \(**Insert Column Before**\) of the column your cursor is in.

**ii.Under "Row"**: You can insert a row above \(**Insert Row Before**\) or below \(**Insert Row After**\) the row your cursor is in.

3Continue editing or click **Save** at the top of the page.

### Delete row or column

1. In edit mode, right-click in any cell in the row or column you want to delete; this will bring up the table editing menu.
2. In the menu, under **Row** or **Column**, select either **Delete Rows** or **Delete Columns** and you will see the row or column immediately disappear.
3. Continue editing or click **Save** at the top of the page.

### Merge cells vertically or horizontally

1. In edit mode, right-click once in a cell to bring up the table editing menu.
2. From the menu, under **Cell**, select one of the two options to merge cells:

   **i.Merge Right**: This will combine the cell your cursor is in with the cell directly _to the right_ of it.

   **ii.Merge Down**: This will combine the cell your cursor is in the the cell directly _below_ it.

3. Continue editing or click **Save** at the top of the page.

### Split a cell in two

1. In edit mode, right-click once in a cell to bring up the table editing menu.
2. From the menu, under **Cell**, select one of the two options to split cells:
   1. **Split Cell Horizontally**: This will create a new cell in the same column, directly below the cell your cursor is in.
   2. **Split Cell Vertically**: This will create a new cell in the same row, directly to the right of the cell your cursor is in.
3. Continue editing or click **Save** at the top of the page.

### Create a table header

A table header will show the first row with formatting to distinguish it from the rest of the table.

1. In edit mode, right-click once in a cell that is in the first row of your table to bring up the table editing menu.
2. From the menu, select the option **Convert to table header**.
3. Continue editing or click **Save** at the top of the page.

### Create a sortable table

You can enable sorting on a table to allow users to select which column to sort items by. With this enabled you will see an up and down arrow in each column once you save the page. Selecting the up arrow will sort all items in the table by that column ascending, selecting the down arrow will sort the items descending. The sorting does not change the underlying data. It will only change the view for the user.

1. In edit mode, create a table header as explained above.
2. Right-click once in a cell in the table header to bring up the table editing menu.
3. From the menu, select the option **Enable sorting**. \(You will not see the sort arrows in edit mode, only when viewing the page.\)
4. Continue editing or click **Save** at the top of the page.

### Hot intranet tips!

**Add text before or after a table**

If a table is the first thing you create when adding a new page, there is a special trick for adding text \(or images/links\) before or after a table. After creating the table, hover above or below the table, and a red dotted line will appear with an **enter key** icon \(or bent arrow\) on the right. Click on the **enter key** icon on the right to create a new paragraph above or below the table.

**Strip formatting when pasting tables from outside sources**

Tables pasted from MS Word or Excel can come with complex formatting that may not function properly on an intranet page. So if you paste a table from elsewhere onto an intranet page, use the **Remove formatting** tool to strip the table of its formatting. Select the entire table area, then click the **Remove formatting** button \(A capital T with a small x in the bottom right - Tx. You'll find the Remove formatting button in the same section of the editor as the Bold, Italic, Underline and Strikethrough buttons\). You will then be able to edit the table just like any table you create on the intranet.
