# Custom News post intro

### How to create a custom introduction for a News post

Use these instructions to add a customized introductory paragraph for a news story. This custom intro will show up in News sections that show content from the Source to which you've added the story. You'll add your custom News story intro in the **Summary** section of edit page.

When you add a new **News item** \(post\) to a News page, the intranet automatically pulls the first few hundred characters of your post and displays that as the post intro on the main News page. With these instructions you can replace the automatically generated post summary with a custom written introduction.

### Edit page and click "Add summary"

1.Navigate to the specific news post and click the **Edit button** \(pencil icon\) to go into edit mode.
