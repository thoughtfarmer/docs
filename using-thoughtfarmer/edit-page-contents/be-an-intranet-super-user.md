**Navigate File or Image Preview: ← and →**

**Click outside a pop-up window to close it**

Most pop-up windows have buttons at the bottom right that allow you to close the window. If you haven't made changes in the window however, you can often close it just by clicking outside of the window.

**Rich Text Editor shortcuts**

Here are a few tricks for getting around in the Rich Text Editor when you are editing an intranet page.

* **Home**: Jumps to the beginning of the line
* **CTRL+Home**: Jumps to the beginning of the document
* **End**: Jumps to the end of the line
* **CTRL+End**: Jumps to the end of the document
* **SHIFT+ENTER**: Adds a line break. We at ThoughtFarmer have found this to be an extraordinarily useful shortcut to know. It's useful if, say, you want to insert an image in a numbered or bulleted list, without having a number or bullet on the left of the image!

* **Did you notice that?** We just used SHIFT+ENTER to help us insert an image in a bulleted list! Sneaky!
* **CTRL+Z**: Undo
* **CTRL+Y**: Redo
* **CTRL+B**: Applies **bold** formatting to text
