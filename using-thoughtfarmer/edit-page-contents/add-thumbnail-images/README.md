# Add thumbnail images

### What is a Thumbnail image?

A Thumbnail image is the image that is displayed with a specific page title when it is referenced in different places on the intranet. The first image you upload to a page will automatically be selected as the Thumbnail image for that page. If you do not upload any images to a page, it will not have a Thumbnail image. You can choose any uploaded image to be the Thumbnail image for the page, or remove the Thumbnail image altogether.  
  
A Thumbnail image must be uploaded to the page it is connected with, but it does not have to display in the page's contents in order to be the Thumbnail image. Web images cannot be selected as the Thumbnail image.

### Use page header image for Thumbnail image

When you add a new page header image, a new option becomes available in the Thumbnail image section - to use the page header image for the Thumbnail image. If the page header image is the only image available on the page, it will automatically be selected as the thumbnail image.  
  
If there are multiple images available on the page, add the page header image to the page, then under the Thumbnail heading on the right, select the checkbox **Use page header image**. The page header image will show in the Thumbnail section, and if you change the page header image in the future, the Thumbnail image will automatically change.
