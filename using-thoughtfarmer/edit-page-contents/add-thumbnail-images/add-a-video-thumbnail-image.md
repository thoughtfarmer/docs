# Add a video thumbnail image

You can choose a thumbnail image that will show when videos uploaded to ThoughtFarmer are embedded in intranet pages, or when videos are displayed in News Carousels.  
  
If you don't add a thumbnail image, by default the frame five seconds into the video will be used as the thumbnail image. If you are an administrator, you can change the default time used to select the thumbnail images. To learn more, see Change default video thumbnail frame.

Note that adjusting the image crop will not change the way the Thumbnail image looks in the Thumbnail section on the right, but your cropping is saved in the Thumbnail settings window.  
 

### Use page header image for video thumbnail image

When you add a new page header image, a new option becomes available in the Thumbnail image section - to use the page header image for the Thumbnail image. If the page header image is the only image available on the page, it will automatically be selected as the thumbnail image.  
  
If there are multiple images available on the page, add the page header image to the page, then under the Thumbnail heading on the right, select the checkbox **Use page header image**. The page header image will show in the Thumbnail section, and if you change the page header image in the future, the Thumbnail image will automatically change.
