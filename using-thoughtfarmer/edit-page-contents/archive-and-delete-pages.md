# Archive and delete pages

### How to archive or delete an intranet page \(and its subpages\)

Use these instructions to archive or delete an intranet page. Archive and delete pages to help keep your intranet tidy and uncluttered. Archived pages are content that is not currently relevant to most users of the intranet. Archived content is hidden from users by default, but users can choose to show or hide archived content from their view, so archived items can still be viewed when necessary.  
  
When you archive or delete a page you automatically archive or delete any subpages or attached files, as well as comments. When you delete a page, you won't have access to any sort of "Recycle Bin" to retrieve the page from, so try to be sure you can really get rid of a page before you click the **Delete** button.

### Choose to show or hide archived content

While archived content is hidden by default, users can choose whether to show or hide archived content from their view on the intranet. When archived content is hidden, it will not show in navigation or recent activity. Archived content is always excluded from search results, but at the top of search results, an option is available to show any archived items found in the search.

1. Click on your name and photo on the top right of any page to open the dropdown menu.
2. Change the **View archived content** toggle to **ON** or **OFF**. Your view will refresh to put the new setting in effect.

If you have chosen to show archived content, it will appear in navigation with the word **Archived** beside the title.

### Archive a page

Archive content on your intranet that is no longer current. When you archive a page, any subpages, attached files or comments will also be archived.

1. Navigate to the page that you want to archive.
2. Click the **down arrow** on the right of the page header to open the **Page Controls**.
3. Click **Archive**. The page will refresh with an **Archived** label across the page header.

If you have chosen not to view archived content, when you archive a page it will disappear from your navigation. This means that if you navigate away from the archived page, you won't be able to navigate back to it, unless you change **View archived content** to **ON** in your settings.

### Set an "expiry date" to automatically archive content

Any time after adding a page, you can set a date for the page to archive. You might set a page with details on a company social event to archive after that event has happened. Keep in mind that if you set a date for a page to archive, any pages below it will also be archived on that date.  
  
The auto-archive feature is the only way to archive a link in the navigation. Because links in the navigation do not have a "view" state like a regular page, there is no Archive option for them in the Page Controls. To learn more, see the **Set a date to archive the link** heading on the [Add link in navigation](../add-pages-and-sections/add-link-in-navigation.md) page.

2. Use the **arrows** on the calendar that appears to navigate to the archive date. Click on the **date** you want the page to archive.
3. The archive date you have selected will now show under **Archive date**.
4. Continue editing or click **Save** at the top right of the page.

To remove the archive date, click the garbage can icon beside the archive date.
