### How to insert images on intranet pages

Use these instructions to insert images such as photos or diagrams on your intranet pages. It's a breeze to add images to your page using image files \(JPEGs, PNGs, GIFs, etc.\) from your computer. You can also add images that are already uploaded to the intranet in galleries or document libraries.  
  
Images really spruce up a page and are particularly snazzy on news and blog posts where they'll draw in and engage readers. You can easily resize images and set them to align on the left or right of the text on your page.  
  
The first image that you insert on a page will automatically become the Thumbnail image on the page. The Thumbnail image may be used to represent the page in search results, News items, page shares and certain navigation or directory areas. To learn about the Thumbnail image, including how to change and crop it, see [How to add a Thumbnail image.](add-thumbnail-images/)

### Image search and galleries

When you insert an image on a page, one of the options in the Choose Image pop-up window is to select an image from a gallery that exists on the intranet. You can also use the search feature in the Choose Image window to find an image that is in a gallery or in a document library.  
  
Your intranet administrator can set certain galleries as **Recommended galleries** that will appear above All galleries in the Choose Image window. Galleries that you have **Bookmarked** will appear with a star beside the title at the top of both the Recommended galleries and the All galleries sections.
