# Rich Text Editor and spell check

### Use the Rich Text Editor to edit pages & comments

The Rich Text Editor \(RTE\) is the content box you use to edit the contents of a page or to post comments. These content boxes include a toolbar with many text formatting functions similar to Microsoft Word \(the toolbar is part of the RTE\).  
  
The rich text editor is also known as a **WYSIWYG** editor \(what you see is what you get\). WYSIWYG editors were created and named early in the life of the internet, when the only way to create a web page was to write HTML code directly. The introduction of WYSIWYG editors allowed you to write the content of web pages in a normal way without needing to be a web nerd.

### "Rich text" means it's formatted with bold, etc.

"Rich text" means text that is formatted, such as with bold and italics, bullets, links, highlighting, headings, etc. The alternative to rich text is "plain text" which consists of simple characters all of the same font, size and color.  
  
When you create and edit content using the Rich Text Editor you are actually creating web pages on the intranet. These web pages are created using HTML code, the basic technical language of web pages. The Rich Text Editor translates your text and formatting into the HTML code that makes up the page.  
  
HTML consists of plain text accompanied by web code tags that specify formatting and display options. You can switch between editing an intranet page using the Rich Text Editor and editing the HTML code of the page directly by clicking the "Source" button in the RTE.

### RTE full screen mode

You can switch the Rich Text Editor to full screen mode by clicking the **Maximize** button in the RTE toolbar. To minimize back to the regular view, click the **Maximize** button again.  


### Spell check

There are two ways to check your spelling in the Rich Text Editor, depending on the settings your intranet administrator has chosen. How you spell check depends on whether you see the spell check icon or not.  
  
**If you see the spell check icon in the Rich Text Editor controls**, then clicking it will underline any misspelled words in the content of your page. Right-click on a misspelled word to see a menu of other spelling options.  
  
**If you don't see the spell check icon in the Rich Text Editor controls**, then your administrator has disabled the intranet spell check in favor of using the built-in browser spell check. Chrome, FireFox, Safari, and some versions of Internet Explorer have built-in spell checkers that will underline misspelled words as you type. Press the CTRL key \(or Command key\) and right-click on a misspelled word to see a menu that includes spelling suggestions.
