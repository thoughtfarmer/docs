### How to embed forms & other content from external websites

Use these instructions to embed external content on a page of your intranet. You can embed many different types of content including [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/), clickable slide shows from [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/), clickable documents from [Issuu](http://issuu.com/), video from private [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/) accounts, forms from [Wufoo](http://wufoo.com/) or [Google Docs](https://www.google.ca/docs/about/), and much more.  
  
In order to embed content from an external website, that website must offer very particular **embed code** which you can copy and specially paste on an intranet page. To find the embed code look for the words **embed** or **share**, angle brackets &lt;&gt; \(an "embed code" symbol\), or the link symbol \(three tiny chain links joined together\). You can learn more about the embed code from those websites.  
  
You can also use [iFrames](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.asp) to display any content from another website under certain restrictions.  
The ability to insert Wufoo Forms is integrated into your intranet software, however, the **Insert Wufoo** button ![6.7User9148WufooIcon.png](https://community.thoughtfarmer.com/imagethumb/222945500000/15869/600x600/False/6.7User9148WufooIcon.png) is not automatically enabled on all Thoughtfarmer intranets. For more information, see [How to add a Wufoo form](add-wufoo-forms.md), or talk to your intranet administrator.

### Two ways to embed widgets and other web content

You can either embed content on an intranet page using the **Insert code** button in the content toolbar or by editing the page's HTML code directly. _The **Insert Code** button is not automatically enabled on all ThoughtFarmer intranets_, so if you don't see it in the content toolbar either contact your intranet administrator or edit the HTML code directly using the instructions below \(if you are not familiar with HTML code this could be tough\).

**Use the "Insert Code" button to embed external content**

1. Click the **Edit button** \(pencil icon\) in the page header to enter edit mode.
2. Set the cursor where you want to embed the content and then click the **Insert Code** button in the content toolbar to bring up the **Insert Code** pop-up box. \(The **Insert Code** button has a pair of brackets &lt;&gt; and a little green plus + sign, over a small white page.\)

3. Copy the embed code from the external website, paste it in the **Insert Code** pop-up window and click the **Insert Code** button. 
4. Continue editing or click **Save** at the top of the page.

**Edit HTML code to embed external content**

To follow these instructions you may need basic familiarity with HTML code.

1. Click the **Edit button** \(pencil icon\) in the page header to enter edit mode.
2. Click the ![6.5User7956SourceButton.png](https://community.thoughtfarmer.com/imagethumb/82934870000/15868/1000x1000/False/6.5User7956SourceButton.png) **Source** button in the content toolbar. This will switch you from viewing the page's content using the RTE to viewing the raw HTML code directly.
3. Set the cursor at the beginning of the line of HTML code where you want to insert the content.
4. Copy the embed code from the external website, paste it into the HTML code and then click the **Source** button to return to the regular page view. 
5. Continue editing or click **Save** at the top of the page.
