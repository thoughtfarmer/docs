# Add Wufoo forms



### Use Wufoo forms to collect information

Forms allow you to collect information from intranet users. You could use forms to collect vacation requests, conduct a survey, or find out what your colleagues plan to bring to an upcoming potluck lunch. Using Wufoo, you can create forms customized to your organization's branding, add various field types for collecting different types of information, and receive notifications about new form entries.  
  
Before you can embed Wufoo forms on intranet pages, several things have to happen:

* You or someone in your organization creates a Wufoo account at [www.wufoo.com](http://www.wufoo.com/)
* Your intranet administrator enables Wufoo integration on your intranet, using information from the Wufoo account that was created,
* Your intranet administrator allows users to embed Wufoo forms. \(If your intranet administrator does not allow this, only administrators will be able to add Wufoo forms to your intranet.\)

For administrator information about Wufoo forms, see [Wufoo forms integration](https://community.thoughtfarmer.com/content/105887).
