# Embed video hosted externally



Our recommended approach is to use an external service like [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/), or [Wistia](https://wistia.com/), in order to upload, host and serve your videos. Since they specialize in this service they are able to provide the most offerings around formats, editing, and performance. You can use embed code they provide and add that directly to ThoughtFarmer pages.   
  
When you embed a video from another site, you insert a player that pulls in the video from the external site where the video lives. Playing a video like this is called **streaming** and doesn't require actually uploading the video file to the intranet. Instead, the video lives on the external website which hosts the video and streams from the external website to all the locations where you embed it. It's like putting TVs in different rooms of the house: The TV stations that play the video are far away, but your TV pulls in the shows and movies you watch.

### Two ways to embed video hosted externally

You can either embed video on an intranet page using the **Insert code** button in the content toolbar or by editing the page's HTML code directly. _The **Insert Code** button is not automatically enabled on all ThoughtFarmer intranets_, so if you don't see it in the content toolbar either contact your intranet administrator or edit the HTML code directly using the instructions below \(if you are not familiar with HTML code this could be tough\).

**Use the "Insert Code" button to embed web videos**

1. Click the **Edit button** \(pencil icon\) in the page header to enter edit mode.
2. Set the cursor where you want to embed the video and then click the **Insert Code** button in the content toolbar to bring up the **Insert Code** pop-up window. \(The **Insert Code** button has a pair of brackets &lt;&gt; and a little green plus + sign, over a small white page.\)

3. Copy the embed code from the external website, paste it in the **Insert Code** pop-up window and click the **Insert** button. A placeholder for your video will now show up on the page.
4. Continue editing or click **Save** at the top of the page.

**Edit HTML code to embed web videos**

To follow these instructions you may need basic familiarity with HTML code.

1. Click the **Edit button** \(pencil icon\) in the page header to enter edit mode.
2. Click the ![6.5User7956SourceButton.png](https://community.thoughtfarmer.com/imagethumb/136707670000/16340/950x950/False/6.5User7956SourceButton.png) **Source** button in the content toolbar. This will switch you from viewing the page's content using the RTE to viewing the raw HTML code directly.
3. Set the cursor at the beginning of the line of HTML code where you want to insert the video.
4. Copy the embed code from the external website, paste it into the HTML code and then click the **Source** button to return to the regular page view. A placeholder for your video will now show up on the page.
5. Continue editing or click **Save** at the top of the page.
