# Embed video hosted in ThoughtFarmer



This method is only supported in ThoughtFarmer 8.0.1.25 or later. If you have a previous build then please contact [ThoughtFarmer support](mailto:helpdesk@thoughtfarmer.com) to coordinate an upgrade. Otherwise, you are restricted to [embedding video using HTML](advanced-how-to-embed-a-video-using-html-code.md) for all video types, or using an external video service.  
  
If your video is in a supported format \(see [Video formats and conversion](video-formats-and-conversion.md)\), then you can upload and preview your video automatically. Additionally, these supported file types will give you embed code right from the document landing page. This code can be used in any ThoughtFarmer page using the "Insert code" tool to add the video in a player.   
  
**Supported file types:** 

* MP4 \(recommended\)
* WebM
* OGV
* OGM

### **To embed the video simply follow these steps:**

1**.Upload your video:** On any ThoughtFarmer page that supports file uploads simply add the video file as you would any attachment. For details see [Attach and reorder files](../../add-and-edit-files/attach-and-reorder-files.md). 

2.**Grab the embed code**: Visit the document landing page for the video. From a document library just click the name of the file and select **Go to file**. From here you will see the video details, a preview for the video and the embed code below that. Click the button **Show embed code** to display the code, then copy it.
