# Insert in-page link



In-page linking is used to provide a link to another heading or section on the same intranet page. It can help people to find the information that is most relevant to them. In-page linking must be enabled by an administrator - To learn more see Configure additional Rich Text Editor settings.  
  
In order to make an in-page link, a user must first create a link target - in other words, they have to specify the place that they want the link to go to. Since you can make multiple in-page links on the same page, each link target must have a unique link target ID.

### How to create a link target ID

1.In edit mode, place your cursor where you want a link to take a user to.

2.Click the **Create a link target ID** button ![8.5User17615LinkTargetIcon.jpg](https://community.thoughtfarmer.com/imagethumb/132126130000/16363/43x38/False/8.5User17615LinkTargetIcon.jpg) \(it looks like a crosshairs icon\) to the right of the Insert Link/Unlink icons. The **Create a link target ID** pop-up window will appear.

### Insert an in-page link

After creating a link target ID, you can now create a link that will go to the target area on the page.

1.In edit mode, use your cursor to highlight the text you want to make into a link. Or just set your cursor where you want to insert the link.

i.Example: "If you have questions, please email ThoughtFarmer."

2.Click the **Insert link** button to bring up the Insert link pop-up window. \(The Insert link button looks like a set of three tiny links in a chain.\)

3.In the pop-up window, click on the **In-page content link** tab. Click in the **Target ID** box and select your link target from the dropdown menu.

5. Click **Insert** in the bottom right. The pop-up window will close and you'll see your text has changed color \(indicating a link\).

6.Continue editing or click **Save** at the top of the page. Now when a user clicks on that link, they will be taken to the target area of the page that you specified.
