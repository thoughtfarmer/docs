### How to insert links to other intranet pages

Use these instructions to insert hyperlinks on your intranet pages that lead to other pages of the intranet. You'll probably be surprised at how much you enjoy inserting links using the ThoughtFarmer Link Manager.  
  
Not only do links liven up text and make you look like a pro, but linking is extremely useful. By linking text in your page to other pages you can make it so much easier for other people to find related information quickly and easily.

### Three ways to insert a link to another intranet page

There are three different, equally cool and easy ways of linking to another intranet page. You can either search for a page or file, drill down into the navigation to find it, or link to a recently viewed intranet page. See steps 4a, 4b and 4c for instructions on each of these options.

1. Click the **Edit button** \(pencil icon\) in the page header to go into edit mode.
2. Use your cursor to highlight the text you want to make into a link. Or just set your cursor where you want to insert the link.
   1. **Example**: _"I just discovered an awesome tool for inserting links on my intranet pages_."
3. ![Insert\_link.png](https://community.thoughtfarmer.com/imagethumb/208045330000/15841/44x39/False/Insert_link.png) Click the **Insert link** button to bring up the link pop-up window. \(The **Insert link** button looks like a set of three tiny links in a chain.\)
4. Find the page you want to link to using one of the following three ways. Once you have selected a page to link to, the page breadcrumb will show in the Link To box near the bottom of the window.

   a.In the **Search** box start typing the name of the page or file you want to link to. Just below the search box you'll see a list of pages and files with titles that match what you're typing. The list automatically narrows down as you continue typing. Click on the listing for the page you want to link to.

7.Continue editing or click **Save** at the top of the page.

### Open link in new window

For all of the above link options, you can choose to have the link open in a separate tab when it is clicked. Just check the box **Open link in new tab**, at the bottom of the link window, below the link label.

### Hot intranet tip!

**Don't insert a link in "click here" text**

Instead, insert the link in the text that describes exactly where the link will go.  
**Example:**

* **Do**: "_Also see_[ _instructions on inserting images_](../insert-images.md)."
* **Don't**: " [_Click here_](../insert-images.md) _to see instructions on inserting images_."

This makes it so much easier to quickly understand where the link leads to.
