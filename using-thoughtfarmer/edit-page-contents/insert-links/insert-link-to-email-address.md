# Insert link to email address



### How to insert a link to an email address

Linking to an email address is very similar to linking to an intranet page.

1.Click the **Edit button** \(pencil icon\) in the page header to go into edit mode.

2.Use your cursor to highlight the text you want to make into a link. Or just set your cursor where you want to insert the link.

**i.Example**: _"If you have questions, please email ThoughtFarmer_."

3.Click the **Insert link** button to bring up the link pop-up window. \(The **Insert link** button looks like a set of three tiny links in a chain.\)

4.In the pop-up window, click on the **Email** tab. Type in or paste the email address you want to link to. The Link Manager tests and verifies the address, which then appears beside **Link path** at the bottom of the Link pop-up window.
