### How to print an intranet page

From time-to-time you may want a paper copy of some information off your intranet - because despite all the amazing things that computers can do with information, sometimes it's just nice to have a paper copy!  
  
Keep in mind, though, that your intranet has several non-tree-using ways to share an intranet page with others or store a copy offline. To learn more, check out [how to export a page to PDF or Word](export-to-pdf-or-word.md), or [how to email a page.](email-pages.md)

1. In your intranet browser, click **File** &gt; **Print**, or right-click on the page and select **Print**. \(or, depending on the browser, you may want to select **Print Preview** first to see what the page will look like.\)

The title and content of the page will print, with extraneous menus and controls stripped out. Some page meta-data \(eg. page title, date, page URL and number of pages\) may print by default in the header and footer of the page.
