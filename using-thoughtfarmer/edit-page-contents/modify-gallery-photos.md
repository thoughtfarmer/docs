### To move gallery photos

You can move gallery photos to other gallery pages, or to non-gallery pages that allow files. If you move a photo under a non-gallery page, it will show as an attached file.  
  
To learn how to reorder images in a gallery, see [Add a photo gallery](../add-pages-and-sections/add-a-photo-gallery/).  
 

1. After selecting the photos, click **Move** in the gallery toolbar. The **Move** pop-up window will appear.
2. In the **Move** pop-up window:
   1. Click the triangle to the left of a page to show or hide its subpages.
   2. Click on any page listed in the pop-up to move your photo there. **OR**
   3. Start typing the title of the page that you want to move the photo under in the **Search** field. Click on the page you want when it appears in the dropdown.
3. Click **Move**. The photo will reload in it's new location and you will see the updated location in the SuperNav on the left.

When you move a photo, it inherits its security settings from its new parent page. So after moving a photo, check its security settings to see if you need to change them.
