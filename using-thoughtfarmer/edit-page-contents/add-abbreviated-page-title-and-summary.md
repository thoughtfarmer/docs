# Add abbreviated page title and summary



### How to create an alternate short title

Use these instructions to create an alternate abbreviated title for a page. This shorter title replaces the page's full title in the SuperNav and breadcrumb trails on the intranet. The full page title will show up in search results and will show at the top of the page when people navigate to it. Abbreviated titles help the navigation look cleaner and simpler and reduce the length of breadcrumb trails.

1. Go into edit mode on the page you want to add a short title to.
2. Click **Add short title** on the right under **Publishing options**.
