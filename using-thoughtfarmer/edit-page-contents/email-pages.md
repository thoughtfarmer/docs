### How to email a page

Use these instructions to bring an intranet page to the attention of a coworker by sending them an email with a link to the page. You can do this from almost all of the pages on your intranet. Your recipient will need to be logged in to the intranet in order to view the page.

1. Navigate to the page that you want to email.
2. Click the **Export/Share** button in the Page Sharing Buttons in the page header.
