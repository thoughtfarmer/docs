# Reorder and move pages



### How to reorder pages and move pages

Use these instructions to change the order in which subpages are listed or move a page or file from one location on the intranet to another. Through a simple drag-and-drop pop-up window you can reorder pages. And with just a few clicks and zero page editing you can move a page or file to a new location.  
  
When you move a page all the subpages and attached files move with it. This means you can move entire sections in one fell swoop.  
  
Moving or reordering pages will not break links to those pages. Each page on your ThoughtFarmer intranet is created with a unique and permanent URL that doesn't change when you move it or change page order \(or change a page's title\).

### Click "Reorder navigation" to change page order

To reorder pages you must be on the page above the set of pages you want to reorder. This is called the "parent" page on which all the subpages live as "sibling" pages.

1. Navigate to the parent page of the pages you wish to reorder. \(Don't go into edit mode.\)
2. Click the **down arrow** on the right of the page header to open the **Page Controls**.

When you move a page, the page inherits its security settings from its new parent page. So after moving a page, check its security settings to see if you need to change them.
