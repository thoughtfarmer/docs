# Reassign a Form entry



### Reassign an entry

In each stage of a submitted form entry’s workflow, it will be “Assigned” to a specific user. This user is responsible for performing the next set of actions that the form entry requires. The user that the form is assigned to at any one point can be set and edited in the form builder, however you may find the need to change the assignment for a specific entry not the entire form. That’s where re-assigning comes in.

1.Locate the form entry you want to reassign on the Entries page.
