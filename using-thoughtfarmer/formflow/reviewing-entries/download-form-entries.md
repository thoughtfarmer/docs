# Download Form entries

Occasionally you may need an overview of the form entries that have been submitted. The Form Entries page has options for you to filter and even download information about form entries.

1. From the Forms Overview page, select the Entries tab.
2. There are two dropdown menus and a search bar that can filter form entries:
   * **Forms dropdown** - This dropdown lets you select All Forms or a specific form.
   * **View/status dropdown** - This dropdown lets you filter form entries by predefined filters or views. You can choose from All entries, archived, in progress, overdue and more.
   * **Search bar** - The search bar works like any other search, it will filter the form entries by whatever keywords you search for.
