# View Form activity



FormFlow keeps track of all the actions performed on a form, and records it in the form’s Activity. It’s a great function to use if you have multiple people managing the form, and you want to keep track of the changes made.

To view a form’s activity:

1.Locate the form in the Form Overview. Locate the ellipses above the form title and select the **Edit** option to open the Form Builder.

2.In the Form Builder, click on the arrow next to the Launch button to open the More Details pane.

3.Click on the **View Activity** button.

4.Activity is organized by day and shows the actions performed on the site in reverse chronological order \(that is, most recent first\). For each action, you will see who performed the action and when they performed it.
