# Translate Forms



If your ThoughtFarmer intranet has been set up with multiple languages, you will have the option to translate your forms. There is no auto-translation, but you can use translated text in a variety of areas, including:

1. Form name
2. Field name
3. Field default value
4. Field help text
5. Multiple choice fields
6. Headings
7. Body copy
8. Workflow statuses
9. Messaging

Translating these areas is a simple change you can make within the form builder.

1.In the form builder, open the editor for the field, status, or message that you wish to translate.

2.Locate the language selector drop down in the editor. By default the selector is set to your preferred language.

4.Enter your translated text in the appropriate boxes and, if required, save.

5.Launch your form when all of your translations are complete to make them live.

6.Your translated text will now appear for all users with that language preference.
