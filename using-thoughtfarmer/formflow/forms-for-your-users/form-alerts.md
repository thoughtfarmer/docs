# Form alerts



As part of the FormFlow feature, the existing Alerts panel has been expanded to include form notifications. Any time a form is assigned to you, you will receive a notification that explains what has been assigned to you and give you quick navigation to the item you’ve been assigned.

1.Locate the Alerts panel in the very top navigation of your intranet, and click it to open the panel.

2.Your notifications will be divided into three tabs: Forms, Notifications, and Mentions.

3.Any assignments you’ve received will appear in the Forms tab.
