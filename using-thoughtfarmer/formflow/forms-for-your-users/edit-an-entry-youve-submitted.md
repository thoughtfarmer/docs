# Edit an entry you've submitted



Not all form submissions are final. If the form’s creator has enabled editing privileges, submitters can go back into form entries that they’ve submitted and change their responses. Note that submitters can only do this if the form is still in the processing phase. Form entries that have reached the final status can no longer be edited.

There are two ways to access your submitted entries:

#### Via the Forms Overview:

1.Find the form that the entry you want to edit is associated with.

2.In the form description, you’ll see a line that reads “Submitted by you” with a number next to it. This line indicates how many open entries you have submitted to this form.
