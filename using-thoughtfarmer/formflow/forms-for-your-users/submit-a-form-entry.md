# Submit a Form entry



Whenever you fill out a form in FormFlow, your response is called a Form Entry. Since collecting entries is really the whole point behind creating forms, FormFlow makes it easy for you to find and fill out a form. There are two ways to submit a form entry:

1.Within a Form Page - if a form is on a page, you can submit your response directly through the page. All you have to do is:

1. Find the correct form page on your intranet.
2. Fill out the form.
3. Submit it.

2.From the Forms Overview - even if the form is not part of a page, you can submit an entry to it via the Forms Overview. To do that:

1. Click on your name in the top navigation and select Forms from the drop down menu.
