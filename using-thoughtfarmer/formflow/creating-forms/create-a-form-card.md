# Create a Form Card



Let users add existing forms to their pages by creating form cards. Form cards are just like any other content card - they are the building blocks of a new page. In the case of Form cards, they will allow the page creator to add, but not modify, an existing form to a new content page.

Form cards can be created one of two ways:

1. Create or modify a global template to include a form card \(note that this option is only available to administrators\) 
2. Create a new page and modify the template to add a form card only to that specific page \(note that this option is only available to users that have Modify Template privileges\).

This guide will cover both methods.
