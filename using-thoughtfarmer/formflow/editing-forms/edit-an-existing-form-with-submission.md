# Edit an existing Form with submission



You’ve published a form and received some entries when a user makes some suggestions on how to improve the form. What do you do? Delete your original form, and all the entries you’ve collected already? Nope! With FormFlow you can make edits to your form even after you’ve received submissions.

The process to make the actual edits is exactly the same as if you were [modifying a form that had not received submissions yet](edit-an-existing-form.md). The only difference is how the changes are treated on the entries you’ve already received. Here’s what you need to know:

#### Adding a new field to the form will add that field to all existing form entries

1. The existing form entries will not display content for the added field.
2. If the field is a required field, the form reviewer must fill in the new field on existing entries in order to make any changes.
3. If the field is a required field and it is added to a section that only submitters can complete, then a reviewer is not required to fill in the field.

#### Editing a field will not change all existing form entries

1. If a field is edited so it has logic applied or is set to be required, the changes will not apply to existing entries.
2. Only if a reviewer edits a form entry will they need to update the data so that it follows the new form rules.
   * For example, if a field is required any reviewers who edit the entry will have to fill in that field before saving their changes
3. If a field is edited to be required and is in a section that only submitters can complete, the reviewer who edits the entry isn’t required to fill it in.

#### Deleting a field will not affect existing form entries

1. The field and data will be still be stored on the existing entries, but a label next to the field will display saying it is no longer collected.
2. Only new form entries will have the field removed from the form.
3. If a reviewer edits a form entry they will have the option to delete the field and data.
