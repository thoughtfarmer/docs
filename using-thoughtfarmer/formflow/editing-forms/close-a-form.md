# Close a Form



There are many reasons you may want to close a form, for example you may want to make edits to the content or you may want to temporarily stop accepting submissions from users. The good news is, it’s easy to close a form and just as easy to relaunch it when you’re ready!

1.Locate the form you want to close in the Forms Overview. Note that you must have editing permission to close the form.
