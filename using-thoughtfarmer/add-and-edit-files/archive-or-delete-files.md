### How to archive or restore a file

Use these instructions to archive or restore a single file. When a page is archived, the available action item will change from **Archive** to **Restore**. Archived content is hidden by default, but users can choose whether to show or hide archived content from their view on the intranet. In order to restore an archived file, you will need to show archived content so you can see the file.

### Delete, archive, or restore multiple files at once

The dropdown menu **Bulk actions** appears above the list of files, and becomes active when more than one file or folder is selected at a time. This menu allows you to move, delete, archive, restore, download or tag multiple files at once. You must have edit permission for a file to be able to apply a bulk action to it. If you have selected a file that you do not have edit permission on, you will see the message "You do not have permission to \[change\] some of the items selected." In order to restore archived files, you must have the option "Show archived content" selected in your settings.

1. Select the files you want to change:

   b.To select multiple non-consecutive files/folders: Click on the first file/folder, then hold the CTRL key and click on each file/folder you want to select.

2. Click **Bulk actions** at the top of the list of files/folders. This opens a dropdown menu.

### Hot intranet tip!

**How to save an accidentally deleted page or file**

Accidentally deleted a file and now you want it back? Fear not. Your intranet site administrator can un-delete files and pages. Here's what you can do:

* **Contact your site administrator** immediately with the following info \(and no matter how frustrated you may feel, be super nice to your site admin!\):
  * List the name of the file, or at least the topic of the file if you don't remember the exact name
  * Note the approximate time you deleted the file
* If all goes well, your site administrator can un-delete the file.

If you find yourself asking your site admin to un-delete files and pages for you frequently, please consider getting him or her some fancy chocolates or a six pack of good beer as a thank you.
