# Open and lock a file for editing



### How to open & lock a file for editing

Use these instructions to open a file on the intranet for editing on your computer and check the file back in once you are done. When you open a file for editing it is automatically locked so others can't edit it until you've checked the file back in.

### Desktop Connector must be running first

![8.0User15651DCIcon.jpg](https://community.thoughtfarmer.com/imagethumb/278948200000/15996/86x109/False/8.0User15651DCIcon.jpg)The features for locking, editing and checking in files rely on an application called the Desktop Connector. The Desktop Connector runs behind the scenes, and you likely won't see much more of it than a little leaf icon on your desktop, taskbar or dock. But in order for you to open a file for editing, the Desktop Connector needs to be installed and running on your computer. The first time you open a file for editing, a pop-up tour will acquaint you with the Desktop Connector, which you then need to install. To do that, follow the instructions below.

### Install the Desktop Connector

If you encounter problems in following the steps below, please contact your intranet administrator for assistance.

1.Navigate to the file that you want to open, and click on the **file title** to open the **File Editing Menu**.

5.When the download is complete, **Open** it. An **Installing** pop-up window appears.

6.When the installation is complete, the install window disappears, and the TF Desktop Connector leaf icon appears in your taskbar.

7.\(optional\) Click on the **leaf icon** to see details about the TF Desktop Connector.

8.Close the **Desktop Connector Tips!** pop-up window. The intranet page will refresh.

9.Click on the **file title** again to open the **File Editing Menu**, and click on **Open for editing**. The file will open on your computer.

If you are using windows 8 please follow the installation steps that are located at this page. [Installation for Windows 8 users](https://community.thoughtfarmer.com/content/105909)

### Click "Open for editing" on individual file page

Once the Desktop Connector is installed on your computer, there are two ways to open a file for editing. You can do it either from the Document Library the file lives in, or from the individual file page.

1.Navigate to the **Document Library** where the file is, click on the **file title** to open the **File Editing Menu**. Click **Open for editing** in the menu that opens. **OR**

2.Navigate to the **individual file page** and click the button **Open for editing** below the file title.

Once the file opens on your computer, start editing as you normally would. When you open a file for editing, the menu **Locked files** appears on the Application Toolbar. In the menu you can see which files you have open for editing, and you can check them back in to the intranet when you are done editing. 

### If someone else is already editing the file

If someone else is already editing the file you want, you will not to be able to open it for editing. This prevents multiple file versions and duplication of work. The **Open for editing** options will not be visible in the File Editing Menu, the file preview, and the file page.  
  
Beside or below the file title, you will see a lock icon and a message such as **Locked for editing by Steven Brown**. You can hover over the person's name to see their mini-profile with contact info, so you can contact them if you want to know when they will be done with the file. On a mobile device, tap the person's name and you will be taken to their profile page.   
  
Occasionally, someone may forget to check in a file when they are done with it. If you need access to a file that is locked, and the person who opened the file for editing can't close it for you \(perhaps because they have left work for the day\), contact your intranet administrator. They can unlock the file for you from the individual file page.   
  
Administrators, to learn how to unlock a file, see the heading **Tip: Unlocking a file for a user** on the [Desktop Connector page](https://community.thoughtfarmer.com/content/105909/desktop-connector).

### Save, close, click "Done editing" to check in & unlock

The final step in checking a file back in is to click **Done editing**, but first you must save the file and close it in the program you used to edit it. Then you can click **Done editing** in one of three places, the Application Toolbar, the Document Library where the file sits, or the individual file page.

1.Save the file you are editing, either by clicking **Save** in the file menu or using the keys **Ctrl + S**. The file will save, without any dialog boxes opening.

2.Close the file in the application you are using to edit the file. Again, you will not see any dialog boxes.

3.Click on the **Locked files** menu in the Application Toolbar at the top of the page, and select **Done editing** beside the file name. **OR**

4.Go to the Document Library where the file sits, click on the **file title** to open the **File Editing Menu**, and click **Done editing** in the menu that opens. **OR**

5.Go to the individual file page and click once on **Done editing**.

When you click **Done editing**, a notification will appear briefly that tells you that a new version of the file has been saved back to the intranet. It will show in the File Controls and on the individual file page that there is a new file version containing your edits.

### Hot intranet tip!

**Preview, download or open files from search results**  
When you perform a search, you can preview files right from the search results to see if that is the file you are looking for. Click the down arrow to the right of the file title to open the File Editing Menu, and click Preview. The File Preview window will open, allowing you to navigate through the first few pages of the file, and view any comments that have been made on the file.
