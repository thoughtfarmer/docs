# Allow and disallow files

### Enable or disable file attachments on a page

Use these instructions to allow or disallow file attachments on a page. To attach files to a page, the page must have a Document Library Card on it. The checkbox **Allow files** needs to be checked in the Update cards window in order for the Document Library Card with the **Add file** option to appear on the page.
