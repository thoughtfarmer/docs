# Rename files and add file summary

### How to rename a file and add a file display name and summary

Use these instructions to change the name of a file attached to an intranet page or to add a file summary. Note that the file display name and the actual file name can be different from each other. This is helpful when the actual file name is complicated, and the contents of the file are more clearly conveyed with a simpler file display name.  
  
The actual file name shows when you download a file, have a file open for editing, and also as the file name on the individual file page. The file display name shows as the file name on the page the file is attached to, in file preview, and as the title of the individual file page.  
  
Add a file summary to help other people quickly comprehend the contents of a file when they find it. File summaries show up in search results, in some navigation sections, and on the file page. They can be accessed by going into file preview, or visiting the individual file page.

### Hot intranet tips!

**\#1: Name files for maximum findability through search**

People are much more likely to search on the intranet than shared/network drives. This means a file's title is very important: Try to name files so people will recognize them in search results.  
  
**Example**:

* **Do**: "_Memo on 2018 Social Intranet Summit lunch options_" or "_Report on ThoughtFarmer webinar demographics, Q2 FY 2017_"
* **Don't**: "_Lunch\_memo_" or "_Q2\_demographics_"
* **The worst**: "_Mtg\_TF_"

**\#2: Link to related files in the file summary**

In the text of your file summary embed links to related files or intranet pages. This will help people find important related information quickly and complete their tasks more easily.  
  
**Example**:

* For a file called "_Travel Advance Form_" include a link to the related travel policy.
* File summary: "_Use the travel advance form to request cash for expenses on an upcoming business trip. See the Travel Policy for details on per diem rates and types of cocktails the company will pay for \(bourbon drinks, yes, tequila drinks, no\)_."
