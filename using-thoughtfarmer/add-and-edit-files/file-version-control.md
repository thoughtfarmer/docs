# File version control



### How to view and revert to previous file versions

Use these instructions to view old versions of a file and revert to previous versions of a file. Every time you replace a file your ThoughtFarmer intranet keeps a copy of the old version. You can quickly see all the past versions of a file and go back to a previous version if you are not happy with a newer version.  
  
When you revert to a previous version of a file, the intranet creates a new version and keeps all old versions intact so you never lose any work. Follow the step-by-step instructions below to use file version control. You can also [see past versions of a file's properties](https://community.thoughtfarmer.com/content/105743) such as name and summary, using the individual file page version control.
