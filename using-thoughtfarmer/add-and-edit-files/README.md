# Add and edit files



### How to attach & edit files of all types

Use these instructions to attach and edit files on intranet pages. You can attach multiple files at once, replace a file, sort files, delete files, open and lock files for editing and then check them back in, view past versions of a file, revert to a previous version and add comments on a file page.  
  
Some of the most common file actions can be accessed in a document library by clicking on a file name to open the File Editing Menu. File information and more file actions can be accessed in a document library by clicking the down arrow on the right of a file. Every file also has its own individual file page where file information and actions are available. You can edit the file's properties to change the file's display name or add a file summary. You can also add tags to files to increase their findability.  
  
Need to manage a large number of files? Use folders to create a document library structure for keeping track of all your files. Curate the order of files for ease of access. Use bulk actions to move, delete, archive, restore or download multiple files or folders at one time.  
  
If you want to link or embed cloud drive files and folders on an intranet page, see [Link and embed cloud drive files](../cloud-drive-integration/link-and-embed-cloud-drive-files.md).
