# Create and manage folders

## Use folders to manage your files

Need to manage a large number of files? Use folders to create a document library structure for keeping track of all your files. Use bulk actions to move, archive, delete, or download multiple files or folders at one time.

## How to create a folder

1. Click **New folder** above the files in the document library. The **Create folder** pop-up window will appear.  ![](../../.gitbook/assets/create-manage-folders-new-folder.jpg) 
2. Type the folder name in the **New folder** field.   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/create-manage-folders-create-folder-window.jpg)  
3. Click **Create folder**. The new folder will appear.

To create a new folder within another folder, click on the folder title to expand the folder contents. Then click **New folder**. To create a new top level folder, click the **folder image** on the left of file navigation breadcrumb to return to the top level of the document library.

## Upload a file into a folder

Add files from your computer directly into a folder on the intranet.

1. Navigate to the page with the folder on it and click on the folder name to select/open it.   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/create-manage-folders-upload-file-into-folder%20%281%29.png)  
2. Click **Upload file** at the top of the list of folders/files.
3. Click **Browse**, find the file you want to upload and click on it.
4. Click **Open**. It may take a few moments to upload the file.
5. Once the file has uploaded it will appear underneath the open folder.

## Move a file or a folder

You can move files that are already on the intranet into a folder. See [how to move a file](attach-and-reorder-files.md) for complete instructions.

## Sort files in a folder

Whole document libraries as well as the files within a single folder can be curated into a particular sort order. To learn more, see [Attach & reorder files](attach-and-reorder-files.md).

## Edit security settings for a folder

You can change the security settings for the page the folder lives on to control who can view and edit the page and folder, but you can also edit the security settings of an individual folder.

1. Navigate to the page that the folder is on.
2. Click the **edit icon** \(a pencil\) to the right of the folder title to open the folder editing page.   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/create-manage-folders-edit-security.png)  
3. In the **Security** section on the right, click on **Security permissions**.   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/create-manage-folders-edit-security-2.jpg)  
4. Edit the security settings as desired. \(For more information, see [how to change permissions to view and edit.](../security-settings-and-permissions/permission-to-view-and-edit.md)\)
5. If you wish to make the folder private \(only the page owner and intranet administrators can view\), select the **Private** checkbox on the right side.   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/create-manage-folders-edit-security-3.jpg)  
6. When you're finished, click **Save**.

## Rename a folder

1. Navigate to the page the folder is on.
2. Click the **down arrow** on the far right of the file name to open the **File Controls**.   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/create-manage-folders-rename-folder-1.png)

## Make changes to multiple files/folders at once

You can move, delete, archive, restore, download or tag multiple files or folders at once. You must have edit permission for a file/folder to be able to apply any of these actions to it. If you have selected a file/folder that you do not have edit permission on, these actions will not be available to you. In order to restore archived files or folders, you must have the option "Show archived content" selected in your settings.

1. Select the **checkboxes** on the left of multiple files and folders.
2. When you select a file or folder, an **Actions** menu becomes available at the top of the document library.   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/create-manage-folders-change-multiple-files-1.png)  
3. Select the action that you want to apply to the selected files/folders. Follow the prompts to complete the desired action. \(See above for more information on moving a file or folder.\)
