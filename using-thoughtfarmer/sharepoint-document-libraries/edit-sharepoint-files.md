# Edit SharePoint files



### How to add & edit documents in SharePoint Document Library Cards

Use these instructions to add folders and files to SharePoint Document Libraries, rename and edit files and delete files. You can insert SharePoint libraries on any page of your ThoughtFarmer intranet using the SharePoint Card to allow quick and easy file access. When you edit or add files via the intranet they are saved directly to the SharePoint library.  
  
If your intranet is connected to SharePoint Online, see [Link and embed cloud drive files](../cloud-drive-integration/link-and-embed-cloud-drive-files.md) to learn more.
