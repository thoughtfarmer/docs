# Link to a SharePoint file



### How to insert links to SharePoint documents

Use these instructions to insert links to files stored in SharePoint libraries. It's just as simple and easy as linking to any intranet page because the ThoughtFarmer Link Manager includes a tab for SharePoint files. You can link to any document in a SharePoint site to which your intranet is connected.  
  
If your intranet is connected to SharePoint Online, see [Link to cloud drive files in page content](../cloud-drive-integration/link-to-cloud-drive-files-in-page-content.md).

### Highlight text & click on Link Manager button

1.Go into edit mode on the page you want to insert the link on. 

2.Use your cursor to highlight the text in which you want to insert a link. Or just set your cursor where you want to insert the link.

* **Example**: _"I just discovered an awesome document about social intranets in a SharePoint library_."

3.Click the **Insert link** button in the content toolbar to bring up the **Insert link pop-up window**. \(The "Insert link" button looks like a set of three tiny links in a chain.\)

4.Click the **SharePoint tab** on the left-hand side of the window.

5.Select a **SharePoint site** from the **Site** dropdown menu.

6.Click once on a folder icon to open it \(clicking on the folder name will select it rather than open it\) and then click once on a document to select it.

7.The **Link Label** box at the bottom of the link pop-up window contains the text that will display as the link. Click in the Link Label box and type new text if you want to add or change the link text.

8.Click **Insert** in the lower right corner of the Insert link pop-up window. The pop-up window will close and you'll see your text has changed color to signify it is a link.

9.Continue editing or click **Save** at the top of the page.
