# Search for SharePoint files



### How to search for SharePoint files on your intranet

Use these instructions to search for SharePoint files using your ThoughtFarmer intranet search engine. Your intranet search results will include documents from libraries in any SharePoint sites to which your intranet administrator has set up a connection. When you click on a SharePoint file in the search results, the document will open in SharePoint rather than on the intranet.  
  
If your intranet is connected to SharePoint Online, see [Search cloud drives](../cloud-drive-integration/search-cloud-drives.md) for more information.

### SharePoint option in search results

1. Search on the intranet as you normally would, by entering a **search term** in the site search box.
2. On the search results page, click on your intranet name above the search box, and in the menu that opens, click **Sharepoint**. The search results will now show results only from Sharepoint.

3.Use **search filters** on the left-hand side of the page to narrow down results.

4.Click once on a document to open it in SharePoint.

To switch back to viewing intranet search results, click on SharePoint above the search box, and in the menu that opens, click on your intranet name.
