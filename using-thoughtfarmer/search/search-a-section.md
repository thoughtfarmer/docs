# Search a section



### How to constrain search to just within a section

Use these instructions to do a Section Search - to search within a specific section of your ThoughtFarmer intranet. This allows you to focus your search efforts by cutting out results from all the sections of the intranet except the one you are viewing. This results in fewer search results to sort through and a higher chance of finding exactly what you need. This search option is most helpful when you know the general location of the content you seek.

### Search section you are viewing in SuperNav

Most pages that have multiple subpages will have Section Search available from the left hand SuperNav.

1. Go to the page whose subpages you want to search.
2. In the left hand SuperNav, under the current page title layer, you will see either the subpage tree navigation, or a box that says **Search \(current page title\)**. If you see the tree navigation, click on the Search icon \(mini magnifying glass\) to the right of the page title. This will bring up the **Search \(current page title\)** \(Section Search\) box.
3. Enter your search term in the box, and press **Enter**. Your Section Search results will appear.
4. Click on a page title in the search results to view the page.

### Search filters in Section Search

You can also search a section using the Filters that show below the section search box, instead of entering a search term. Click on a filter category to see the available filters in the category. Then click on a filter to bring up search results by filters. You can click on multiple filters to further narrow down your results.  
  
You can also perform a search by first using a search term, and then using filters to further narrow down your results.  
  
There are **five filter types** available: 

* **Type:** See only results that are a certain content type. eg. Groups, Calendars, Files.
* **Edited By:** See only results that have been edited by a certain person.
* **Owned By:** See only results that are owned by a certain person.
* **Posted Date:** See only results that were created within a certain time period.
* **Tag:** See only results that have been tagged with a certain tag.

### Select "Section" in search dropdown menu

You can also perform a Section Search using the search dropdown at the top of the page, rather than using the SuperNav.

1.Go to the page whose subpages you want to search.

2.Click on the Search icon on the right of the Application Toolbar to open the Search dropdown. 

3.Click on **All** above the **Search** box, and select **Section** from the menu that opens.

4.Click in the **Search** box, enter your search term, and then hit **Enter** or click the search button \(mini magnifying glass\).

5.Scroll down through the list of results or click on search filters on the left-hand side of the page to narrow down results.

6.Click on a page title in the search results to view the page.

### Expand a Section Search to the whole intranet

If you have performed a Section Search using a search term or filters, you can choose to expand the search to search the whole intranet. Near the top of the the search results page, just below the search box, you'll see the name of the section you are searching listed as a filter, along with any other filters that you've selected.  
  
To expand your search to the whole intranet, click the **X** on the filter that contains the name of the section you have searched. Then your search results will show a search of the whole intranet using the other search terms or filters you have selected.  
 

### Hot intranet tip!

**Link to a search results page**

Want to share your search results with a colleague? Just grab the URL of your search results page and send it or post it as a link on an intranet page. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to a page and perform a Section Search.
2. On the search results page, copy the URL from the web page's address bar.
3. Paste the URL in an email or IM, or add it as a link on an intranet page. \(See complete instructions on [how to insert links](../edit-page-contents/insert-links/).\)

**End result**: When a colleague clicks on the link, she'll be taken directly to the search results page.
