# Search the Groups Directory

### How to find groups using the Groups Directory

Use these instructions to search the Groups Directory on your intranet. You can narrow down the results using special search filters for group type and for tags. Depending on whether you are viewing the Group Directory in Grid View or List View, you'll see the group name, number of group members, a list of group members, the location of the group within the site's navigation and a "Join group" button if it is an open group.

### Select Groups Directory Grid or List view

You can choose to view the Groups Directory in one of two ways: Grid view or List view. Grid view displays groups in a grid of cards with the group logo, group name, number of group members, and an option to join open groups. List view displays groups in a vertical list, and may include the names of group members and location information. Grid view will likely allow you to see more groups on your screen at one time. Grid view and List view may display different information about groups depending on the settings your intranet administrator has chosen.

**List View**

Grid view is the default view of the Groups Directory, but the way you view the Groups Directory is controlled by you and specific to you. To change your view, click the Grid or List icons on the top left of the Groups Directory, just under the number of groups. The intranet will remember your last selected view preference, and will display the Groups Directory that way next time you visit it.

**Options**:

* List of categories of groups

Click on a category, such as **Location** or **Project** to narrow down results to just group pages that fit within that category.

**Filter 2: Tag**

**Options**:

* List of top tags used for each tag bundle, plus search box

Use the **Tag** filter to see only the group pages to which someone has added a specific tag. You'll see listed the tags used most on the pages that show up in the search results. Click on one of the tags listed to see only results that have that tag.

### Type in a specific tag to narrow results

For the **Tag** filter you can type in a specific tag to narrow down results.  
  
At the bottom of the **Tags** filter list look for a small search box. Start typing in a keyword and a list of matching tags will automatically appear; click on the one you want and the search results will refresh with that tag filter applied.

### Hot intranet tip!

**Tag your group page so people can find it**

Colleagues may come looking for your group in order to find information they need or to connect with group members. Add tags with useful keywords so people can find your group more easily.  
  
Ask yourself this question to come up with good tags: _**What words would I use to search for this group page six months from now?**_  
  
For every word or phrase you might use to search for the group, add a tag to the group landing page.
