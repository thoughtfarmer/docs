# Browse all site content



### How to browse site content

Use these instructions to browse through all the content on your ThoughtFarmer intranet. Browsing content allows a slightly different way to search the intranet and find exactly what you're looking for: It lets you start looking for something using content filters rather than a search term. For instance, you can select a specific person or tag to narrow down search results. You can also start by narrowing your search criteria to just a specific content type \(eg. Document, Page, or Comment\) or a date range.

### Click "Advanced Search" in Search dropdown

1.At the top of any page click on **Search** in the Application Toolbar. The Search dropdown will open.

2.Click **Advanced Search** in the top right of the Search dropdown.

b.Under **Edited by** or **Owned by** click on a name in the list, or type a name in the search box, click on the matching name from the list that appears. This will show you everything on the intranet edited by or owned by that individual. **OR**

c.Under **Posted date** click on one of the date ranges to see everything on the site posted during that period. **OR**

d.Under **Tag** click on one of the tags listed, or click in a **Find tag** box and start typing a tag to find tags in that tag bundle. Click on the matching tag in the list that appears. This will show you everything on the intranet that has that tag.



4.In the search results page use other filters to further narrow down your results.

### Browse intranet content using the SuperNav

You can also browse through a tree navigation view of the intranet content using the left hand SuperNav on any page of the intranet. The layers of the SuperNav show the location of the current page within the hierarchy of the intranet. Click on the triangle beside page titles in the SuperNav to display or hide the navigation below that page. The path to the current page is still highlighted while you browse through the navigation. You can browse through the site navigation without leaving the page you're on. If you want to visit another page in the SuperNav, just click on the page title to go to that page.
