# Security settings and permissions



### How to change permissions and privacy

Use these instructions to change permissions for who can view and edit a page. You can use Security settings to give permissions to individuals or give permissions to many people at once using Security Groups. You can create a Security Group from a group page's membership, and then use that to extend permissions on other pages. You can also make a page totally private. When you change Security settings on a page, its subpages inherit those changes by default.
